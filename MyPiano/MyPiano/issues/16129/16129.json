      "Message": "The code will compile just fine in VS2008 .NET 3.5. In fact, the core NAudio library still uses .NET 2.0. It is only the demo projects.\r\n\r\nThere is a good reason why VS adds System.Linq by default to all new files, and that is because LINQ works on extension methods. It is really annoying to manually have to add an extra using statement every time you start typing LINQ. So I have no real motivation to go around removing these using statements. Maybe in a future Visual Studio it will intelligently notice you are using LINQ keywords and put the using statement in for you.",
