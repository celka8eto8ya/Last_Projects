      "Message": "`Position` (and `CurrentTime`) is intended to work in conjunction with `Read` - they are both part of the `WaveStream` interface. But `ReadNextFrame` is just a low-level way to get the next MP3 frame, and so it's not expected you are using these other properties. But I agree it would be nice to fix this up if its not too difficult.",
