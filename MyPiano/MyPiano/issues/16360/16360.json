    "Description": "I noticed that once I read some values from an AudioEndpointVolume, my application would crash when I changed the volume manually afterwards. After some searching, I traced the problem to AudioEndpointVolumeCallback where OnNotify gets called when the volume changes. \r\n\r\nIn this method Marshal.PtrToStructure is used, which causes an access violation, causing the crash.\r\n\r\nI'm running Win7 x64 and the latest Naudio (b3a412ad55a8)",
