    "Description": "Hi\r\n\r\nI have been trying to use the, playbackstopped eventhandler on the wavout class.  I am trying to get a playlist to cycle through audio tracks so at the end of each track it evaluates the playlist and plays the next valid track. For some reason NAudio crashes when I do this at the .init() call I have had a look at the PlaybackStatus  and it seems to still be at Playing when the playbackstopped event is or has been called.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions....\r\n\r\nif you want my project off me please give me a shout moogus@hotmail.co.uk\r\n\r\nDarren",
