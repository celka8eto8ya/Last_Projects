    "Description": "Are there plans to support NAudio in a a Windows 8 Metro app? I cannot get NAudio to work in a Windows 8 Metro app with the Win8 consumer preview and Visual Studio 11 beta. \r\n\r\nFirst, NAudio has a dependency on System.Windows.Forms.dll, and when I add that reference to my project it usually crashes Visual Studio 11.\r\n\r\nSecond, if I can add the reference to System.Windows.Forms.dll without crashing Visual Studio 11, I get a compiler error: \"Cannot find type System.Resources.ResourceSet in module mscorlib.dll\"\r\n\r\n",
