    "Description": "I want to use the StreamMediaFoundationReader class in my application, to process the signal form the microphone in real time (i.e. without using disk I/O). I tried adding StreamMediaFoundationReader.cs to the project, but it threw a bunch of reference errors when I tried to compile. So, I looked up the required source code, added those files and tried again, and again...\r\n\r\nSo far, I have added these files to the project, with no end in sight:\r\n\t\r\n\tAcmInterop.cs\r\n\tAcmStream.cs\r\n\tAcmStreamHeaderStatusFlags.cs\r\n\tAudioCapture.cs\r\n\tMp3FrameDecompressor.cs\r\n\tNAudio.Wave.cs\r\n\tStreamMediaFoundationReader.cs\r\n\t\r\nAm I doing this the hard way? Can I install a library or do I just have to keep iterating as I've been doing, until there are no more reference issues?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n- Al",

I have confirmed that 'StreamMediaFoundationReader.cs' is in the compile include list in 'NAudio.csproj', so I don't know what is wrong.\n\nDo I need another 'using' statement? (I only have 'using NAudio' and 'using NAudio.Wave')",
