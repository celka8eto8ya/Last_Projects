    {
      "Message": "Glitches can be due to the audio processing getting interrupted, or discontinuities in volume level. I suspect the first is what you are hearing when you click the title bar (maybe a garbage collect happens), and the second is what you hear when changing volume. One way round this is to not do sudden volume movements, but smoothly ramp the volume multiplier to the target value. You'd need to write a custom sample provider to do this though.\n",
