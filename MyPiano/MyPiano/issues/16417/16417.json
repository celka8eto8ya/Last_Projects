    "Description": "Hi.\r\nI'm creating MIDI files in my program and the time signature is just completely wrong.  I do this:\r\n\r\nTracks.AddEvent(new TimeSignatureEvent((long)AbsoluteTime, TimeSigNum, TimeSigDen, 24, 8), 0);\r\n\r\nwhere TimeSigNum would be 4 and TimeSigDen would also be 4.\r\nAs far as I know, the MIDI clock is 24 so that's how many ticks in a metronome tick there would be, and if my math is right, there are 8 32nd notes in a quarter note.  Yes?\r\n\r\nBut if you open the file in Sonar or Acid, it shows up as 4/16\r\n\r\nSetting it to 4/2 results in 4/4, and 4/8 shows up as 4/256\r\n\r\nWhy does it do whatever to the denominator?\r\n\r\nOr am I doing something else wrong?\r\n\r\n(My PPQN is 96, if that makes any difference.)(Attached is the MIDI file, if you want to look inside.  It should be 4/4)\r\n",

Silly college people never mentioned the negative power part, they just said use the regular numbers.\n\nSad that a guy on a personal RoadRunner page got it right (even though I missed it the first time around).\n\nDan",
