    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI have an issue with NAudio: in simple application i'm playing for example wav file, and when I change system volume by draggin mixer manually in windows taskbar - application crashes. It doesn't throw an exception, but \"stops working\", even in debug mode.\n\nAnybody have simple issue and can help?\n\nI'm using DirectSoundOut or WaveOut (function callback).\nCode for loading wav file is pasted from one of NAudio samples.\n\n//Update: I'm using NAudio source code 63489\n\nI will really appreciate any feedback. Thanks.\n\nMike",
