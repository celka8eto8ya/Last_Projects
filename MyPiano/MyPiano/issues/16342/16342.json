    "Description": "Repeatedly pausing and resuming a WaveOut object sometimes reduces the buffering functionality. Resuming using the Play function does not have this problem (because it calls EnqueueBuffers before resuming).\r\n\r\nProposed fix: make the WaveOut Resume function private to force users to use the Play function to resume.\r\n\r\nThis solution might solve issue 15702 as well.",
