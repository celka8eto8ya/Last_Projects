    "Description": "Hello,\r\nI'm reading some wave files using AsioOut and a WaveMixerStream32. Everything works great but I noticed that sometimes (1 time on 5) when I close and start again my program, I have a loud signal playing in the output of my audiocard and I have to restart the app to delete the signal and come back to normal.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it's the asioOut which stays open or something like that.\r\nWhen i close the app, I'm doing the following :\r\n1.  I remove all the input stream in my audio mixer and I stop the asioOut\r\n_asioOut.Stop();\r\n\r\n2. After 0.5s, I dispose all the mixer, the channels and asioOut and set them to null.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong here?\r\nHow can I get rid of the loud signal ? \r\n\r\n(My audio card is a Komplete Audio 6 and it's compatible asio driver)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help !",
