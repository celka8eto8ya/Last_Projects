    "Description": "\r\nI have some 6-channel .WAV files and used oggenc to convert it to ogg.  After this conversion, the 6th channel was corrupted and not audible. I have tried SOX, FFMPEG, all got the same results.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is because the encoder assumes that 6 channels means a 5.1 surround audio and creates one Low Frequency Effect (LFE) channel. \r\n\r\nHow to avoid this? I need a 6-channel ogg file (without a LFE track). \r\nThanks for your help.",
