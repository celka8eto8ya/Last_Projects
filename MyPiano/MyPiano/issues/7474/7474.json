    "Description": "The callback delegates aren't pinned and for example the asio driver sdk sample crashed immediately, surprised it didn't happen for the developer of this great lib! Here's the simplest fix I came up with:\n\nasiodriver.cs:\n\n        public void createBuffers(IntPtr bufferInfos, int numChannels, int bufferSize, ref ASIOCallbacks callbacks) \n        {\n            pinnedcallbacks = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(Marshal.SizeOf(callbacks)); //+\n            Marshal.StructureToPtr(callbacks, pinnedcallbacks, false); //+\n            handleException(asioDriverVTable.createBuffers(pASIOComObject, bufferInfos, numChannels, bufferSize, pinnedcallbacks), \"createBuffers\");\n        }\n        static IntPtr pinnedcallbacks; //+\n\n        public ASIOError disposeBuffers()\n        {\n            Marshal.FreeHGlobal(pinnedcallbacks); //+\n            return asioDriverVTable.disposeBuffers(pASIOComObject);\n        }\n\n\npublic delegate ASIOError ASIOcreateBuffers(IntPtr _pUnknown, IntPtr bufferInfos, int numChannels, int bufferSize, IntPtr callbacks); //-ref ASIOCallbacks",

I have adapted the code to my needs (multi input/output support), but I don't think, that the crash has something to do with these adaptions, because they are localized above the driver.\r\nThe interop base is still the same. And after long time of debugging I cannot find any reason in my code for this crash. The trace is lost in disposeBuffers() and Marshal.Release(pAsioComObject).\r\nHad you tested your Line6 or any other device with the actual naudio version?\r\n\r\n",
