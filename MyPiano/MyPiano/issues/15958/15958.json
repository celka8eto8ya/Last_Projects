Also I have a new PC now that is 64 bit (finally) so I will be able to properly test the interop in Win 64 bit myself and hopefully not have to have that flag set. (see my post here for more info on why NAudio is set to target x86: http://mark-dot-net.blogspot.com/2011/05/naudio-and-nuget-and-x64-problem.html)",
