    "Description": "Hi Mark\r\n\r\nThanks for providing the library! First I thought, that my problem was simple: I have 4 different Audio Files, that I want to play on a multichannel soundcard. Each file has to go to a separate Audio out. I manage to do this one time, the playback stopped event handler doesn't work, the disposing doesn't work, destroying all the objects and building them up again doesn't work. I don't know what to do...\r\n\r\nI need to playback all the files every hour or so... Is there a simple way to do this?\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance.\r\n\r\nBr\r\nRomy",

      "Message": "With ASIO, you open all the outputs at once. So all 8 channels. And then you provide 8 channel audio as the input. And NAudio has two helper classes for this purpose - `MultiplexingWaveProvider` and `MultiplexingSampleProvider` that glue together stereo files and send them to the appropriate output. Check out [my blog post](http://markheath.net/post/handling-multi-channel-audio-in-naudio) on how to use them.\n",
