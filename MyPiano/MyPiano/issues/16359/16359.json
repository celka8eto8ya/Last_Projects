    "Description": "I use the MP3FileReader  to open a mp3 which is in the attachments , the total time returned is 05:09. And I use the NAudio demo to play this mp3, the sound is slower than expected.\r\n\r\nBut if I use other players like foobar to open this mp3, the total time is 03:41, and sounds normal.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a bug in this class.",
