    "Description": "I recently purchased a Logitech Gaming headset that works fine in all applications and games, except a game that is using the NAudio functions. At any point in the game where sound appears to be processed by the NAudio dll, the game crashes. I contacted the developer and after looking at the error logs they stated that NAudio doesn't support the Logitech audio drivers. \r\n\r\nBelow is an excerpt from the log file: \r\n\r\n[12/24/2016 6:02:05 PM.820] SirenMastery: at NAudio.Wave.WaveOutEvent.Init(IWaveProvider waveProvider)\r\n[12/24/2016 6:02:05 PM.820] at ?????????????????????????????????????????.????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????(WaveChannel32 , ????????????????????????????????????????? , Boolean )\r\n[12/24/2016 6:02:05 PM.820] at ?????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????(Model )\r\n[12/24/2016 6:02:05 PM.820] at ?????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????()\r\n[12/24/2016 6:02:05 PM.820] at Rage.GameFiber.Main()",

      "Message": "Yes, the latest drivers were downloaded from Logitech. It appears that the issue occurs when using the Logitech Gaming Software which enables the surround sound for the headset via either Dolby or DTX. If that software is removed from the system, the game functions although all surround sound functions are lost. \n\nI did read on Logitech's website that Microsoft was requiring mfg's to use the \"ABO drivers\" to support surround sound and to not rely on the Microsoft OS for providing that function. \n\n",
