My recommendations if your company really really needs signed DLLs for some reason:\n1) sign it yourselves\n2) hire me to make a special signed version just for you ;)",

      "Message": "There shouldn't be any problems, just open the project file in Visual Studio, in Properties find a Signing tab and create a new pair of keys, which should then be added to all projects - or to a common AssemblyInfo, if you have such one :-)\n\nJokes aside, it'd be really nice to have a signed version in order to avoid fetching the source code for recompilation/resigning... Nuget does the job of getting the library, I'd rather not intervene with it :-)",
