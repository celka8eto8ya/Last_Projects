    "Description": "hi,\r\ndunno if this is a current issue anymore or if it's really really the case at all in your software:\r\n\r\nusing the sf2 part of your software (the renoise tool \"sf2xrni\" uses it), the first sample (some left C-3) has 2 to incorrect additional values at the beginning, and probably all samples have it too but just go into the zero-padding of the previous one\r\n\r\nat least that's what the output of sf2xrni looked like\r\n\r\nwhen i made my own sf2 to xrni code, i did at first not read the 32 bit integer coming after the \"smpl\" chunk id, and i got the same result\r\ni changed my code to read a 32 bit chunk size after \"smpl\" and it a) seems to be the sample data size and doesn't break parsing b) the first sample is now correct",
