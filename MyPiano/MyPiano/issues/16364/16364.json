    "Description": "In file: aiffFileReader.cs, function:ReadAiffHeader(), tenth statement (ignoring braces) reads:\r\n while (br.BaseStream.Position < br.BaseStream.Length)\r\n\r\nbut this crashes because some (but not all) aiff files have a padding of one byte; so the Position is one less than the Length, but NOT enough to be another Chunk. As a workaround, I did this:\r\n while ((br.BaseStream.Position + 1) < br.BaseStream.Length)\r\n\r\nbut a better solution may be:\r\n while ((br.BaseStream.Position + sizeof(AifChunk)) < br.BaseStream.Length)\r\n\r\nI realize this is a bit of a kluge, but these files play correctly in other media players, so some protection is warranted.\r\n\r\nJake",
