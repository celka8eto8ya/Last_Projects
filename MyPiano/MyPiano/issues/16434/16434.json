    "Description": "Got the following exception:\r\nAn unhandled exception of type 'System.InvalidOperationException' occurred in NAudio.dll\r\nAdditional information: Got a frame with channel mode Mono, in an MP3 with 2 channels. Mp3FileReader does not support changes to channel count.\r\n\r\ncode looks something like this:\r\n            this.ActiveFile = \"some_valid.mp3\";\r\n            waveOutDevice = new WaveOut();\r\n            audioFileReader = new AudioFileReader(this.ActiveFile);  <----- Exception here\r\n\r\nWorks fine for most files I throw at it, so presumably this particular file is encoded in a weird way?\r\nIs there a way to test for this, and work around it?  Other audio players have no trouble playing this particular file. I'm kind of at a loss at how to handle this.\r\n\r\nApologies if this has been brought up before, searching for this exception didn't yield any results :-(",
