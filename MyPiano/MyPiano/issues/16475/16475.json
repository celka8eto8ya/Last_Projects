    "Description": "I'm currently making a music game in Unity which requires me to load arbitrary music files at runtime. I've used NAudio successfully to support mp3s; however, m4a files (and anything else that uses MediaFoundationReader) causes NAudio to hang inexplicably.\r\n\r\nThis line of code causes the problem:\r\n\r\nvar audioFileReader = new AudioFileReader(fileName);\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that this works fine in the NAudio demo. I tried porting the Demo code straight up to Unity, but the same code that works perfectly in the demo causes a hang inside Unity.\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging, I tracked it down to this function:\r\n\r\nprotected virtual IMFSourceReader CreateReader(MediaFoundationReaderSettings settings)\r\n    {\r\n        IMFSourceReader reader;\r\n        MediaFoundationInterop.MFCreateSourceReaderFromURL(file, null, out reader);\r\n        __reader.SetStreamSelection(MediaFoundationInterop.MF_SOURCE_READER_ALL_STREAMS, false);__\r\n\r\nThat last line fails to execute, Unity freezes and never resumes. \r\n\r\nA quick lookup on MSDN has this to say:\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374655(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\nMinimum supported client\r\nWindows 7, Windows Vista and Platform Update Supplement for Windows Vista [desktop apps | Windows Store apps]\r\n\r\nI am running Windows 8. My current fear is that Unity's Mono implementation simply doesn't support this at all and I cannot use any Media Foundation classes.\r\n\r\nAny insight would be strongly appreciated.\r\n\r\nRepro steps: \r\n\r\n1. Setup an empty Unity project (I'm using Unity 5, version shouldn't matter)\r\n2. Import NAudio\r\n3. Have a simple script that tries to load a .m4a file using NAudio\r\n4. Unity hangs and crashes.",
