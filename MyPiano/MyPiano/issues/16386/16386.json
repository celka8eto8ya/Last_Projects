    "Description": "I have written an application that uses nAudio to play wav files when 'events' happen, and records audio from the microphone.\r\n\r\nI am occasionally getting a System.NullReferenceException from NAudio.Wave.WaveOutEvent.PlaybackThread()\r\n\r\nI am using nAudio 1.5.4. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what causes it, and how I can resolve it?\r\n\r\n",

It all happens very quickly, so I expect that the issue is related to load/speed.",
