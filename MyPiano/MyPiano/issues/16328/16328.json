    "Description": "So, i was streaming some Mp3's and noticed that some song were being play'd to fast and some to slow.\nAfter checking what bitrate the Mp3Frame were returning, i found that some songs got 128kbps when they in face were 222kbps, and other got 160kbps when they in face were 128kbps.\n\nAfter digging around in the code, i found that there are some problems reading the MPEG header, as it requires the header to be at the first bytes of the song.\nThat's not always the case. So i got to work and have made a solution, that streams around 1k at the time and scans is for the header.\nIt works wonderful and i'll try to replace the original method in the following days, if that's alright! =)\n\nSorry for any possible spelling or grammar issues =)",
