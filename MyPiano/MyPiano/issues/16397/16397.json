    "Description": "How can i convert 32 bit PCM  wave into 16 bit PCM??\r\n\r\nI was making software to record system volume using LoopBackCapture. Its capturing data of 32 bit PCM ( 32 bit PCM: 48kHz 2 channels wBitsPerSample:32 dwChannelMask:3 subFormat:00000003-0000-0010-8000-00aa00389b71 extraSize:22 )\r\n\r\nI want to convert it into a 16 bit stereo data....I am not able to get it...\r\n\r\nIts my code to convert the data from 32 bit PCM into 16 bit PCM. I am getting some noises and some real song data. Need help...\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Private Function FX32TO16(ByVal input As Byte(), ByVal len As Integer) As Byte()\r\n        Dim output As Byte() = New Byte(len / 2 - 1) {}\r\n        Dim outputIndex As Integer = 0\r\n        For n As Integer = 0 To len - 1 Step 4\r\n            output(outputIndex) = input(n + 2)\r\n            output(outputIndex + 1) = input(n + 3)\r\n            outputIndex += 2\r\n        Next\r\n        Return output\r\n    End Function\r\n```",
