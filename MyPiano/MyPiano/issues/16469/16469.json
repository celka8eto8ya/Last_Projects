      "Message": "I'm afraid I can't that MIDI file, but I suspect it's just a Type 0 MIDI file. In MIDI, there is a difference between a \"track\" and a \"channel\". MIDI has 16 channels that you can use, and in a Type 0 MIDI file, all the events for all the channels are stored on a single channel, whilst in Type 1 files you can create as many tracks as you want. \n\n",
