    "Description": "Here is an audio generator to test the installation (Pink noise, white noise, Sweep, Sin, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth) with PhaseReverse.\nFrequency Fixed or variable.\nWaveforms and frequencies were correct with external software (SmaartLive7) and an oscilloscope.\n\n\nThere is nothing unusual in the calculation of waveforms.\n\nIntegration into NAudio a IWaveProvider or ISampleProvider.\n\nFiles Attachment: Class WaveGenerator.cs and complement for demo.\n\nI suspect that this class will not be used much but it just still be useful",
