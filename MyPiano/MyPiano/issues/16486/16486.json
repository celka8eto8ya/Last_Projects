    "Description": "When I use a WaveOut device, I get a nice property called Channels, which tell me the number of output channels. Presumably, I don't need such one for AsioOut, as they all are mono (right?). But DirectSoundOut could have a different number of channels - and I see no way of figuring this out.",
