    "Description": "I am trying to build an application in c# visual studio, in which I want to play 2 wav files at certain dB values simultaneously. I looked into many stackoverflow questions but didn't find any useful answers.\r\n\r\nMy scenario is : before using the application user fill the 2 different dB values for 2 wav files. So I am facing two problems -\r\n\r\n1. I am not able to figure out how to play two wav files on ceratin dB values?\r\n2. How can I validate that the wav file is being played on the dB value, I provided.\r\n\r\nI tried using the WaveChannel32, mediaplayer and Naudio but it didn't help.\r\n\r\nAny help will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks, Robin",
