    "Description": "If i clear BufferedWaveProvider when its empty, i get an exception that it doesn't point to an object.\r\n\r\nThis should be fixed, or rather, adjustable, as in some cases one could want to be certain that it's empty, and not want to close the application (or force Try/Catch) just because it happened to be empty).",
