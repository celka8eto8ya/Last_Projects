    "Description": "This exception happens every time with a specific mp3 I am playing back, at a specific time in the mp3. The exception is on the line:\r\nArray.Copy(conversionStream.DestBuffer, 0, dest, destOffset, converted);\r\n\r\nconverted has a value of: 23040\r\ndest is a: {byte[9216]}\r\n\r\nHence the not long enough message. I couldn't tell you what's going on under the hood to explain why there's this mismatch. I've only seen it with this one mp3 so far, but it happens consistently.",
