    "Description": "When I connect to a machine via remote desktop, the WaveOut playback fails with a MmException: WaveBadFormat calling waveOutOpen. The callstack is:\n\n\tNAudio.dll!NAudio.MmException.Try(NAudio.MmResult result = WaveBadFormat, string function = \"waveOutOpen\") Line 40\tC#\n \tNAudio.dll!NAudio.Wave.WaveOut.Init(NAudio.Wave.WaveStream waveStream = {NAudio.Wave.WaveChannel32}) Line 100 + 0xe bytes\tC#\n \tNAudioDemo.exe!NAudioDemo.AudioPlaybackForm.buttonPlay_Click(object sender = {Play}, System.EventArgs e = {System.EventArgs}) Line 84 + 0x18 bytes\tC#\n\nThe playback works fine when I'm directly logged in on that same machine.\n\nWhen using remote desktop, sounds from other application are correctly sent over the network to the client machine. So it not a general problem with sounds in a remote session.\n\nDoes anybody know what is going on here and if there is a fix?",

When calling MmException.Try(result,\"waveOutOpen\"); in WaveOut.Init, the WaveFormat of waveStream is set to IeeeFloat (32bit/44.1 kHZ).\r\n\r\nAgain, this works locally but not over a remote desktop session.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping!",
