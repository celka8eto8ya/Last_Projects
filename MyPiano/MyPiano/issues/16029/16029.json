    "Description": "Using the playback stopped event in WaveOut seems to put the stream into an incorrect state.\r\nIt reports the completion of the stream correctly but it won't play again.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nWhen I stop the stream using Stop() I also set file.CurrentTime = TimeSpan.Zero, that way when the user presses play on the same file using Play() it should start again.  When the stream finishes and the PlaybackStopped event is fired, pressing play does not play the steam again.  I need to press Stop, then Start for it to work.\r\n\r\n       public void StopTrack()\r\n        {\r\n            wavePlayer.Stop();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void StartTrack()\r\n        {\r\n            this.wavePlayer.Play();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        void wavePlayer_PlaybackStopped(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            file.CurrentTime = TimeSpan.Zero;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nNearest I can tell is that the PlayBackState still remains in the Play State if the event is fired when the stream finishes, but when the Stop() function is called then it changes to a Stopped state correctly.",
