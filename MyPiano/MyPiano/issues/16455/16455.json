    "Description": "Normally you'd expect Stop() to stop playback and seek to the beginning, but it doesn't.\r\nIn the following code:\r\n```\r\n_myWaveOut = new DirectSoundOut(device);\r\n_myAudioFileReader = new AudioFileReader(path);\r\n_myWaveOut.Init(_myAudioFileReader);\r\n_myWaveOut.Play();\r\n// ...\r\n_myWaveOut.Stop();\r\n_myWaveOut.Play();\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\nAfter Play() is called for the second time, the file starts playing from the position it was at when Stop() was called. Please change this so it starts playing from the start like it should.",
