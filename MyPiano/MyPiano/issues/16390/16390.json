    "Description": "According to msdn, the size of the MIXERCONTROLDETAILS.paDetails buffer should be:\r\n\r\n(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd757294(v=vs.85).aspx)\r\n_For MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_MULTIPLE controls, the size of this buffer should be the product of the __cChannels, cMultipleItems and cbDetails__ members of the MIXERCONTROLDETAILS structure. For controls other than MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_MULTIPLE types, the size of this buffer is the product of the cChannels and cbDetails members of the MIXERCONTROLDETAILS structure._\r\n\r\nBut the buffer size is now calculated as: __mixerControlDetails.cbDetails * mixerControlDetails.cChannels__\r\nThis will make the mixerGetControlDetails method to write beyond the allocated memory, and thereby corrupting the heap.\r\n\r\nAttached is a patch file that will calculate the buffer size correctly.",
