    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI wrote a proxy that must manage a microphone (with WaveIn) and players Wav / PCM (with BufferedWaveProvider).\r\nEverything works fine and I can manage up to 7 wav streams simultaneously) except that when you physically unplug the speakers, my class, based BufferedWaveProvider, remains silent until you restart the computer.\r\n\r\nIs this normal behavior ?\r\n\r\nExcuse my broken English\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nRGO",
