    "Description": "I think I found a small bug in NAudio.Midi.PitchWheelChangeEvent:\r\n\r\nThe Pitch property accepts values up to (and including) 16384. \r\nIf, however, I create the event with that maximum value, the bit-shifting part in GetAsShortMessage() comes out as 0: \r\n```\r\nConsole.Write( ((16384 & 0x7f) << 8) + (((16384 >> 7) & 0x7f) << 16) ); //-> 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the maximum value should actually be 16383.\r\n\r\n(The reason I noticed this is because the Mackie Control I work with uses PitchWheel events for its faders and when I programmatically move the fader to its top position, it always goes to the bottom.)",
