    "Description": "The Demoprogramm works fine with MME, DirectX, Vista - but when I want to use ASIO Playback, I get a Bluescreen of Death.\nI tried to debug the driver, all works file until the start() command.\nThen in the VS-Output Window I notice a FormatError and then I get a BlueScreen.\nMy Drivers are working fine with e.g. Samplitude - so I think this is not an Issue.\nCan anyone help? Maybe it's because it's a 4-Channel ASIO Card and the ASIO-SDK manual says as soon as you call start() the driver begins playing and sampling.",
