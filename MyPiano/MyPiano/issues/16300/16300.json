    "Description": "Hello,\n\nMay I propose that the NAudio project is strongly signed (using .snk-file, no password) so that it can be used as-is together with other strongly named assemblies? It'll still be usable with unsigned assemblies so backwards compatibility shouldn't be an issue.\n\nGreat library, btw!\n\nRegards,\n\nPer",

Will try to get this done for NAudio 1.5",
