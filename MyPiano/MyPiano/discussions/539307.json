    "Html": "Hi, I think this is an unfortunate side-effect of a change I made to fix another issue. In WasapiCapture's constructor, I convert the device's MixFormat to a &quot;standard waveformat&quot;. In other words, I prefer a WAVEFORMATEX to a WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE. THis is so that anyone who is creating a WAV file can just use WasapiCapture.WaveFormat directly and not get a weird wave format that not all players can play. However, it appears some soundcard drivers require WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE. You can fix this either by modifying your own copy of WasapiCapture to not include the offending lines below, or by resetting the WaveFormat property to a WaveFormatExtensible again before you start recording.<br />\n<pre><code>        /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Initialises a new instance of the WASAPI capture class\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        /// &lt;param name=&quot;captureDevice&quot;&gt;Capture device to use&lt;/param&gt;\n        public WasapiCapture(MMDevice captureDevice)\n        {\n            syncContext = SynchronizationContext.Current;\n            audioClient = captureDevice.AudioClient;\n            ShareMode = AudioClientShareMode.Shared;\n\n            waveFormat = audioClient.MixFormat;\n            var wfe = waveFormat as WaveFormatExtensible;\n            if (wfe != null)\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    waveFormat = wfe.ToStandardWaveFormat();\n                }\n                catch (InvalidOperationException)\n                {\n                    // couldn't convert to a standard format\n                }\n            }\n        }</code></pre>\n\nHope this makes sense, and it's definitely on my list of things to sort out for the future.\r<br />\n<br />\nMark<br />\n",
