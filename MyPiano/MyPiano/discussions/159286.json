I have already learned that WASAPI is generally&nbsp;not SRC-friendly, but I have seen that the <strong>ResamplerDmoStream</strong> is used by the <strong>WasapiOut</strong> class to do on-the-fly conversion, and I'm wondering if something similar could be done with the <strong>WasapiCapture</strong> as well.</p>\r\n<p>Even if it's not implemented in the class itself, there should be a way to connect the ResamplerDmoStream to the WasapiCapture...?&nbsp;If the WasapiCapture was an IWaveProvider it would be easy but unfortunately it's not. I was also looking for a straightforward way to move data to the Resampler in the DataAvailable event of the Capture, but what would I construct the Resampler on then...? Some kind of a generic WaveStream I would guess, but I haven't found such a class. What I'm essentially missing is a stream that represents the WasapiCapture or to which I can write the captured audio data.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe someone has an idea if the above is possible without too much hassle...? Thanks in advance!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Michael</p>",
