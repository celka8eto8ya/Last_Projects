I used source code from NAudioDemo - FadeInOutDemo, and this is the code:\r<br />\n<br />\nprivate IWavePlayer wavePlayer;\r<br />\nprivate AudioFileReader file;\r<br />\nprivate FadeInOutSampleProvider fadeInOut;\r<br />\nprivate string fileName = &quot;C:\\music\\intro.mp3&quot;;\r<br />\n<br />\nprotected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />\n<pre><code>    {\n        if (!Page.IsPostBack)\n        {\n            Debug.Assert(this.wavePlayer == null);\n            this.wavePlayer = new WaveOutEvent();\n            this.file = new AudioFileReader(fileName);\n            this.fadeInOut = new FadeInOutSampleProvider(file);\n            this.wavePlayer.Init(new SampleToWaveProvider(fadeInOut));\n            this.wavePlayer.Play();\n            timer1.Enabled = true;\n        }\n    }</code></pre>\n\nprotected void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />\n<pre><code>    {\n        if (fadeInOut != null)\n        {\n            fadeInOut.BeginFadeOut(5000);\n        }\n        timer1.Interval = 150000;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\nI am still not sure why does FadeOut only occurs in desktop app and not in web app, I appreciate your help.<br />\n",

Do you have some aspnet example of FadeInOut?\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards,\r<br />\nVlad<br />\n",
