However the converting function requires WAV to be saved into harddrive. <br />\nIs there any solution which can provide me with WAV stream or someting else, but in memory only? <br />\n<br />\nCurrent conversion is: <br />\n<pre><code>using (Mp3FileReader reader = new Mp3FileReader(mp3File)) {\n                WaveFileWriter.CreateWaveFile(outputFile, reader);\n            }</code></pre>\n\nI would like to give my program 2 input MP3s and save one final mixed WAV.<br />\n",
