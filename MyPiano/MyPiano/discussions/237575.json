I made some changes, like Yamaha XG Sysex a.s.o, but I didn't find the solution to calculate the length of a midifile.\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to compare the length-value from mci-api, absoluteTime, Tempo and deltaTicksPerQuarterNote (from class MidiFile) but it seems that here is no relation.</p>\r\n<p>Please, could you post how the midifile length (in ms) can be calculated?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks of all midibase:)</p>\r\n",
