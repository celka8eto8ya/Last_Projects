Here goes....\r<br />\n<br />\nI need a way to &quot;add&quot; music to whatever is coming in through the MIC jack but without hearing it on the local computer.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this possible with NAudio please?\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is the scenario I have been given...\r<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Imagine that you are on a call on Skype and whatever mp3 is played using the software is played in a way so that the skype user on other end can hear that and not the user playing it.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nAny advice would be much appreciated. I'm a bit of an audio newbie sorry :)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\n<br />\nTrev<br />\n",
