I've created 2 windows form application (C# 4.5) one is the server (a UDP server for dealing with packet and other stuff ) and one is the client application . Now from client I want to open an mp3 send it to the server and server send it to other clients connected (this part is done . I can easily broadcast the data received to all clients connected). How can I do the first part (the client one) ? Until now I have something like this on my mind: <br />\n<ul>\n<li>open mp3 file via Mp3FileReader</li>\n<li>\nat this step I don't know what to do. -&gt; I think I need to do something with  a buffer like while playing the mp3 file, store data to a buffer then encode it and send encoded data to the server .<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI followed your courses on pluralsight but .. I can't understand them in all of their mean. I'am an 18 years old programmer who is at the beginning of his career :) So if you could help me I will really appreciate your effort.<br />\n",
