    "Html": "<p>1. ByteBufferCount is not calculated automatically - it needs to be set manually if you want to use it. Just set it to e.BytesRecorded</p>\r\n<p>2. Normally you use 2 buffers. One is being filled up, while the other is being processed. You can use 3 if you think your app might struggle to always finish processing a buffer in the length of time that the other one is being used. It matters more for WaveOut, as it allows you to get ahead of yourself and avoid playback glitches, at the expense of having higher latency.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
