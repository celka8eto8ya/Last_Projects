The transmission and decpding works very well but sometimes</p>\r\n<p>during playback i have small gaps, in this case the playback buffer is zero filled. I am using BufferedWaveProvider for playback.</p>\r\n<p>How can i avoid this? This happens also when i buffer more data.</p>\r\n<p>The Waveformat is 8000 kHz, 16 bit, mono.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks...</p>\r\n<p>Tobias</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
