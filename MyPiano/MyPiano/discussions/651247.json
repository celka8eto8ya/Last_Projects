Ideally, the user would be able to see the levels of different frequencies in the spectrum and select functions when the frequency gets to a certain level. I have looked around and tried to find a tutorial on getting an audio spectrum, and all I could find was how to display the waveform of a file. Any help that you could provide would be greatly appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nRobbieC97<br />\n",
