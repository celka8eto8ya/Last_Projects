I remember that there used to be a distinction between playing music and sounds, so you could only play a few music tracks (normally you would only need one) however you could play unlimited sounds. So lets say you have a game with an ambient water running music, and ambient wind music, then you had a random wolf howl or cracking twig sounds then finally any player or monster interactions would have sound effects, such as hitting sounds and moving sounds etc.</p>\r\n<p>Now from what ive looked over with NAudio everything just seems to be music data, so be it a 3 minute ambient track i want repeated or a 2 second sound effect i want to play once then not play again for another 20 seconds, they seem to all load the same, which appears to be great but im a bit unsure as to the limitations of this, as im sure there is a maximum amount of channels available to play music on with a system.</p>\r\n<p>Again i dont know too much in this area so am walking in the dark at the moment, am i able to do what i need to with NAudio? if so do i need to play things differently from the simple creating a waveout and playing it?</p>",
