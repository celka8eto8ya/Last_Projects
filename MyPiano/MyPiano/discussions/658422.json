I would like to have the UI show the total playing time for each file and so far the only way I can see to get this is to create a wave provider object, get the Total Time property, and then dispose of the wave provider.\r<br />\n<br />\nI guess I could keep the wave provider open ready for the user to play it, however there could be many files in a set and this seems overly resource wasteful.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny other ways of getting this total file time?\r<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nSid<br />\n",
