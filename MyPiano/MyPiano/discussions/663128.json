    "Html": "I have a working incoming UDP audio stream being routed to a WaveOut device.  I would like\r<br />\nto pass the incoming audio to a buffer instead of the WaveOut device, so that I can pass the buffer to another already coded DSP engine, using pointers to the buffer.  The buffer would act as a kind of FIFO.  There is a lot to absorb with regards to the available interfaces in NAudio.  Anyone have a suggestion what the signal chain items would be for this application.  Regards,  Karin \r<br />\nPS: Anyone have any idea when this site will be migrated????<br />\n",
