Your best bet at the moment is to download the source code and look at how some of the demo applications work. You will also need to learn a bit about how audio sampling and WAV files work which will make things a lot clearer about how to do merging and splitting of WAV files. There are lots of resources on the internet that explain sampling and WAV files.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark<br>\r\n",
