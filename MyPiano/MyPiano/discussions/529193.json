It should be 2048 floats/samples (1024 per channel).\r<br />\n<br />\nAre you sending the FFT data to a spectrum analyser?\r<br />\n<br />\nspectrum analysers only need 2048 FFT floats every 100ms to draw a smooth animation.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou should really use a Sample Aggregator to collect the samples and tell it to send the data 10 times a second. The Aggregator may look complex at first but believe me its quite simple and the best way to do it. At least give it a try.<br />\n",
