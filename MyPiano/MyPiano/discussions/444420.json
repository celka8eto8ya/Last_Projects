If i use what i posted here, it basically works, but &quot;stutters&quot;.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hello Mark,<br />\n<br />\nthanks for your fast answer.<br />\nAs you suggested, i tried it with WaveFormatExtensible now, which works partially.<br />\n<br />\nPartially in the sense that it works sometimes perfectly, but sometimes i have the &quot;stutter&quot; effect again. I already increased all timers and the application itself isn't even using 1% cpu according to the taskmgr, so that shouldn't be the problem.<br />\n<br />\nThe WaveFileWriter writes directly to the hdd, so not buffered,right?<br />\nI have an ssd in the macbook, but could that be the problem? <br />\n<br />\nthanks again<br />\nstreppel<br />\n<br />\nEDIT:<br />\ni'm stupid...setting the same event multiple times isn't a good idea, that will trigger too often and the result will be wrong values<br />\ni think this fixed it :)<br />\n",
