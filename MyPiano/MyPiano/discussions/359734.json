I dont want the application stuck due to an open messagebox since this is intended for untrained users who dont even interact with\r\n the PC directly. An exception or log message would be ok since it can be handled silently and other parts of app can continue to run.</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to disable the messageboxes?

There are some heavy-handed ways of disabling Debug.Assert (e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2854024/how-to-prevent-debug-assert-to-show-a-modal-dialog). Alternatively, get the NAudio code and do a release build and these won't be included. In the future I plan for official releases of NAudio to be done with release builds, but I have tended to use debug builds in the past as I find these asserts helpful for tracking down problems.</p>",
