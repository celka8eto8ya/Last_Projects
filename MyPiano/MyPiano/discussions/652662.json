This then needs to be encoded to GSM610, then sent across the network to a monitor. The network methods is not a problem - I have done that already. I can capture the speaker sound or the mic and encode. I do not seem to understand how to get the mixing and resampling done. Any guidance would be welcome.<br />\n",

There does not seem to be separate buffers for each device. Or I do not know where they are. </li>\n<li>I can capture speaker OR mic, not both at the same time. Seems my original message was misread.</li>\n<li>The outputs are in float format. This needs to be converted to byte for transfer over the network. WaveBuffer seems to only go one way, and can't convert float to byte.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "Html": "1) the buffer for each device can be found in the eventargs &quot;e.buffer&quot;, if theyÂ´re equal you might record the same device twice ;)\r<br />\n2) as far as I know, you can record many devices at the same time\r<br />\n3) you can recieve the bytes of your float data using the method described <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1215326/open-source-c-sharp-code-to-present-wave-form\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Anyway, you should create a BufferedWaveprovider for each device and put your recorded data into them. Then create a MixingWaveprovider and add all BufferedWaveproviders as input. Finally, on a looped background thread, create a buffer and read the data from the MixingWaveprovider into it. Then you can resample as I mentioned above and send the bytes over network.<br />\n",
