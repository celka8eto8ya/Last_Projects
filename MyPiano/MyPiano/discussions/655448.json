I am then using the stream to  WaveFileWriter to save it then to Wave file. the issue is that the generated audio file is very noisy.  to Investigate I made :\r<br />\n<br />\n   1- Open PCM to other application , when try to set PCM to &quot;unsigned&quot; , i get the same noisy data as the wav file generated by NAudio. When I set the PCM as &quot;Signed&quot; , i get clear audio data. \r<br />\n<br />\n   2- When i open the PCM bytes, it is unsigned , ie data are from  0-255\r<br />\n<br />\nmy code for save the PCM stream is :\r<br />\n<br />\n   Private Mywriter As WaveFileWriter\r<br />\n   Mywriter = New WaveFileWriter(&quot;D:\\xxx.wav&quot;, New WaveFormat(8000, 8, 1)\r<br />\n   Mywriter.Write(Buffer, 0, Buffer.Length) ' after receiving the PCM stream\r<br />\n   Mywriter.Close()  ' to push the wav file \r<br />\n<br />\nkindly advice<br />\n",

    "Html": "I'm afraid I do not know what the issue is here. Are you sure it's linear PCM. Also, bytes in a file are neither signed nor unsigned. They are just 8 bits of data, and whether you treat them as signed or unsigned is the decision of the reader of the file.<br />\n",
