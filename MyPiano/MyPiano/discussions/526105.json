I have asked a few questions in the blog post I mentioned, and one suggestion I got was that I could ask WasapiOut for the WaveFormat. However, I am using NAudio 1.7, the preview release of WinRT support, and there is only WasapiOutRT, which doesn't seem to have this option. \r<br />\n<br />\nFor now I have hard coded the sample rate to 48000, and it works great on my device, but I'd like the code to work on other machines as well. \r<br />\n<br />\nDoes anyone have an idea of how to do this? \r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards, \r<br />\nHÃ¥kan <br />\n",
