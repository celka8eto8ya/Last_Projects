So I would need to have 4 difference circular buffers, presume convert them to a common wave format, multiplex them and play.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso might want to have the choice to use local mp3's instead of streams on one channel, but I presume I could insert the file bytes into the buffer instead of the socket data.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny Suggestions ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in Advance :)\r<br />\nMike<br />\n",

    "Html": "hi Mike, I think you are along the right lines. The multiplexer can take inputs from BufferedWaveProviders or Mp3FileReaders, so as long as all input formats were the same it should just work. You might want to make custom streams to let you queue up MP3s, and handle the conversion.<br />\n",
