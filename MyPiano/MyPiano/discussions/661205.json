This means setup the volume for the incoming mic wave data from the remote side(not changing the mic himself on the other side). I use Waveout and BufferedWaveProvider to get incoming buffers and make it hearable.\r<br />\n<br />\nI failed to use the SampleChannel class(based on the examples), no effect here.\r<br />\nNow i use IWavePlayer.Volume but i got depricated warnings to use the volume on the WaveProvider. The problem is: I can not find any property to do that in the BufferedWaveProvider(IWaveProvider) i use. \r<br />\n<br />\nAny advise whats the strategy now?\r<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
