I don't know if my WaveOut actually got disposed or not, the debugger just continues execution.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm I doing something wrong? How can I implement the wanted functionality?\r<br />\nI tried to look into NAudio's source code to check if there is anything I missed but either my skills are to bad to understand what is really happening or there isn't anything I'm doing wrong.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance :)<br />\n",
