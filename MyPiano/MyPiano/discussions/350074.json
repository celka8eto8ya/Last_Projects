    "Html": "<p>hi Rimsey,</p>\r\n<p>I'm sorry you find the code complicated. NAudio is a library for going beyond simple tasks like audio playback, which you can use SoundPlayer or MediaElement for. It is for when you want access to the raw samples, so by its nature it will be more complicated. The NAudioDemo project contains lots of small demos showing different uses. There is the simple audio playback form which shows very basic playback.</p>\r\n<p>The source code zip file for 1.5 is indeed missing a project, but i always recommend using Mercurial to get the latest source code anyway. The source zip will be fixed for the next release.</p>\r\n<p>That email address is an old one. Best way to get in touch is through codeplex.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
