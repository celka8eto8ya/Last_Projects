Currently it continues to run and even shows the sound levels when not recording (after the initial record and hitting back).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any help would be great - I tried invoking a stop wave command, but it isn't working out for me.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you again for any guidance.</p>",
