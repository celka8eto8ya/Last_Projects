The playback stopped and program froze. After some forum searching, i found the solution through the PlaybackStopped event on WaveOutEvent, i just started the same song at the last position, problem solved.\r<br />\n<br />\nBut, if i play through the speakers and plugs in the headphones, there is no sound. If i unplug, the speakers play again. The same happens, after my first solution, if i start with headphones in, unplugges, and the playback is reinitiated through the fix and plugges them in again, there is no sound. Only through speakers.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm i missing something? my guess is that i need to reinitiate the playback when plugging in the headphones, but how would i know when to do that?<br />\n",

You'd need to browse the MSDN documentation and see if you can find it, then have a look at the NAudio wrappers and see if you can call it.<br />\n",
