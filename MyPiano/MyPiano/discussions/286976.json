Im study the VoiceRecorder project and i could only view the pitch when the recorded file is being read( on &#65279;AutoTuneUtils class). Is\r\n it possible to get the pitch in realtime?&nbsp;Thank you..</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Well all that is needed is to make sure you have the right number of samples. Because of the use of FFT, you need a power of two. So you could set up your buffer sizes carefully so that each DataAvailable has exactly the right number of samples, or you could use a CircularBuffer and when you have enough pass a chunk of samples into the AutoCorrelator. Use Buffer.BlockCopy to go from byte[] to float[] (assuming you are recording in mono)</p>",
