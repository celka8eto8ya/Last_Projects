I get the error message that it's still being used by my process. I call this function when my form closes:<br />\n<pre><code>        private void clearTemp()\n        {\n            System.IO.DirectoryInfo dir = new DirectoryInfo(Path.GetDirectoryName(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location) + &quot;\\\\_tempfiles\\\\&quot; );\n\n            foreach (FileInfo file in dir.GetFiles())\n            {\n                file.Delete();\n            }\n        }</code></pre>\n\nAnybody got a solution? I was thinking by closing the wavefilewriter process first but i dont know if that's possible. Thanks in advance!<br />\n",

Kind of makes sense because it's just the control.<br />\n",
