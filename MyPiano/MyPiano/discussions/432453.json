    "Html": "a WAV file does not have a &quot;gain&quot;. You can examine the value of each individual sample though. Probably the easiest solution is to use AudioFileReader, which has a Volume property which you can use to amplify. (1.0 means leave unchanged). Then to go back to a 16 bit WAV file you use SampleToWaveProvider16 and pass this into WaveFileWriter.CreateWaveFile.\r<br />\n<br />\nMark<br />\n",
