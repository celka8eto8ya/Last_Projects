Also, with specifing the device in the class constructor it stopped working.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, hereÂ´s my working winforms sample code. Just copy into a VB Winforms app, reference to NAudio and place a Waveformpainter on the Form.<br />\n<pre><code>    Dim WI As IWaveIn = Nothing\n    Private Sub FormMain_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load\n        WI = New WasapiLoopbackCapture()\n        AddHandler WI.DataAvailable, AddressOf DataArriving\n        WI.StartRecording()\n    End Sub\n\n    Private Sub FormMain_FormClosing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.FormClosingEventArgs) Handles Me.FormClosing\n        If WI IsNot Nothing Then\n            WI.StopRecording()\n            WI.Dispose()\n        End If\n    End Sub\n\n    Private Sub DataArriving(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As WaveInEventArgs)\n        For index As Integer = 0 To e.BytesRecorded - 1 Step 8\n            Dim sampleleft As Single = BitConverter.ToSingle(e.Buffer, index)\n            Dim sampleright As Single = BitConverter.ToSingle(e.Buffer, index + 4)\n            WaveformPainter1.AddLeftRight(sampleleft, sampleright)\n        Next\n    End Sub</code></pre>\n\nThe code should display the audio waveform of your windows mixer.\r<br />\n<br />\nFF<br />\n",
