This seems to be due to a failed CRC check on the in-memory frame, and I'm not sure what is the root cause for that.<br />\nOne suspicion I have is memory alignment - i.e. buffers aligned differently in VS vs outside of VS, causing zeros to be padded before or after the unmanaged flac buffer memory.<br />\n<br />\nI wish we had a fully managed (.NET/C#) flac library. <br />\n<br />\nI'm going to write a small console test app, without NAudio, that tries to reproduce the libFlac issue.<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas or help on this are welcome.<br />\n<br />\nYuval<br />\n",
