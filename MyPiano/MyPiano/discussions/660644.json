I know the float array is based on the original wave stream which is a stream of bytes.<br />\n<br />\nFrom the waveIn stream I normally get values of up to about 20 000. <br />\n<br />\n20 000 in binary is 01001110 00100000, <br />\n<br />\nNow expand that out to 32 bits and you get 00000000 00000000 01001110 00100000<br />\n<br />\nand that is 0.00238... which is the sort of numbers that I am seeing. &lt;- This is actually the Mantissa or something value<br />\n<br />\nIs that what's happening? I'll do a bit more digging and see if it adds up.<br />\n",
