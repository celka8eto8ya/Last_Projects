I have several URLs of the radio streams to test - BASS library supports all of them but i dont want to use unmanaged code in my application with managed wrappers. And i want to know\r\n - what stream types does NAudio support? Does it support streaming MP3, WMA, AAC, or OGG?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n",
