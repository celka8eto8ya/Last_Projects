There is a note, &quot;Better performance if you use the overload that takes an array, and reuse the same one&quot;.   Is there already this overload function somewhere buried in the NAudio source?  Or do I have write this myself.  My experience with C# has been good but still in a very steep learning curve.  Any Advice???\r<br />\nRegards,   Karin <br />\n",
