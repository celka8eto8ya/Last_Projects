My streaming source provides the duration (in seconds) at the beginning of the stream and I would like to display a progressbar,\r\n but I need a way of tracking how much of the stream has been played. This is an MP3 stream and thus I am following the 'Streaming MP3 example', but I am at a loss on how to track the amount of played stream.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n",
