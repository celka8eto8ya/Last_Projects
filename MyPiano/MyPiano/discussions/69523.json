    "Html": "<p>Hi there,</p>\r\n<p>By default WaveIn uses a Window handle for callback. Since it looks like you are in a console application, nothing will process the message queue for the window it creates.</p>\r\n<p>If you have the very latest NAudio code, you can call <strong>new WaveIn(WaveCallbackInfo.FunctionCallback()) </strong>and it should work for you. (older versions had a boolean property UseWindowCallbacks or something similar but I am bringing it into line with the way WaveOut works). Let me know if you encounter any problems.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
