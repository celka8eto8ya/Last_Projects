I had many conversations with him a few years back, and was hopeful that he could contribute some of his ideas to NAudio, but he has decided to do his own thing. I certainly would be up for collaboration in the future if that is possible. He has put some good ideas into cscore, and has the advantage of having a fresh start with the API rather than having to maintain backwards compatilbility. One idea I've had in mind for a while is possibly giving NAudio a bit of a fresh start for version 2.0, making more breaking changes, and maybe moving to GitHub at the same time. \r<br />\n<br />\nAnd if he is the original creator and has given his permission, that is great, and there should be no problem incorporating it into NAudio. Because NAudio is used in a lot of large commercial applications, it is important that there are no question marks over the origin of the code it contains.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou should be able to add extra commits to your existing pull request. I do code review all pull requests to NAudio, and hopefully over the next week or so I'll get round to this. NAudio is just a spare time hobby project for me, and the amount of emails I get about it has got to the point that I can't keep up any more. I have 90 still waiting for a response at the moment. But I do try to prioritise things like this, and I'll be looking at your pull request over the next few weeks.\r<br />\n<br />\nOne thing I do ask contributors if possible is to also write some documentation about how to use the classes they add to NAudio.
