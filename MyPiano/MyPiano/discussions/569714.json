Like listening to a two way radio.<br />\n<br />\nAt the moment if we have 20 seconds of audio, 20 seconds of silence, 20 seconds of audio. We have a buffer of 40 seconds of audio. <br />\n<br />\nHow would I go about inserting silence between the received audio?<br />\n<br />\nThanks again.<br />\n",
