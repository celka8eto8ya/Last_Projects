    "Html": "I have an extractor that I use to download videos from YouTube but I want to convert them into an MP3.  I have made the work around to download the audio as an ACC file but I am following all of the docs and I am just not able to encode to mp3 without some type of error.  The error usually has to do with unauthorized access but the code I created waits for the file to download, convert to a Wave File and then deleting the original ACC file.  I am wondering what I may be able to do to jump straight to encoding the downloaded ACC file to mp3.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks guys and gals.<br />\n",
