In Windows 7 it seems to work fine.\r<br />\nIt returns the name of the playback device as it is shown in the Sound Panel, which might add a number in front of it if you have multiple usb soundcards with the same name connected to the computer.\r<br />\n<br />\nApparently the propertystore does not contain the key with guid PKEY_DeviceInterface_FriendlyName of the chosen device in Vista, while it does have this key in windows 7.\r<br />\n<br />\nDoes anyone know what might be the correct guid for this in Vista?\r<br />\n<br />\nPS: this is the key: new PropertyKey(new Guid(0x026e516e, 0xb814, 0x414b, 0x83, 0xcd, 0x85, 0x6d, 0x6f, 0xef, 0x48, 0x22), 2) \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",
