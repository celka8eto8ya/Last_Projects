It's really awesome.</div>\r\n<div>Secondly, for comming back to the point, I wanted to know if it's possible for you to use&nbsp;<span>Git</span>&nbsp;as distributed version control system for your source code repositories.&nbsp;<span>Git</span>&nbsp;makes extending and contributing to\r\n the projects much easier than with Subversion and CVS - no more any need to 'join the team' or to 'ask for write access', just fork and code. Whenever we have something ready simply ping you so you can pull from our fork and integrate it back into mainline.Git</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Valeriu</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>I'm doing that already. I've forked the NAudio source code and it's ok. Nonetheless i think that Github, which is more than just a git server control, it offers more of a social coding network and brings more contributors to interesting projects, like this one. It offers a greater visualisation of changes occuring on all the differents forks with links to your commits hierarchy. The same for the code browsing ... The web interface of github is way faster / better then CodePlex.</p>\r\n<p>But in the end, I'm not saying that CodePlex is not good enough but I'm just proposing you to take a look (whenever you have some free time) on GitHub. You might like it.</p>\r\n<p>Here's a url to one of my projects source code browser :&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/lvaleriu/bltoolkit\">https://github.com/lvaleriu/bltoolkit</a></p>\r\n<p>, all forks graph :&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/igor-tkachev/bltoolkit/network\">https://github.com/igor-tkachev/bltoolkit/network</a></p>\r\n<p>Valeriu</p>",
