For generating the tone I used the\r\n<a title=\"Sound Code: Playback of Sine Wave in NAudio\" href=\"http://mark-dot-net.blogspot.com/2009/10/playback-of-sine-wave-in-naudio.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nSine Wave Tutorial</a> but changing the frequency while the tone is playing leads to a clipping. Can someone explain this?</p>\r\n<p>Is there a possibility to playback a wav or midi file and changing the pitch in realtime?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Alex</p>\r\n",
