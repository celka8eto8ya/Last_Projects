So, in order to set WaveOut to use 4 buffers that are all 20 msec long, I need to initialize it as:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>waveOut = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> WaveOut() \n{ \n  NumberOfBuffers = 4,\n  DesiredLatency = <span style=\"color:#008000\"><strong>77</strong></span>\n};\nwaveProvider = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> BufferedWaveProvider(waveFormat)\n{\n  BufferDuration = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(<span style=\"color:#008000\"><strong>80</strong></span>) \n};\nwaveOut.Init(waveProvider);</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>It's all fine except when I want to set the DesiredLatency, I need to reverse the formula that is used to calculate the buffer size, and work it out to get a value, which happens to produce the buffer length I need.</p>\r\n<p>I am going to use it in my code as above, but I think it would be better if I don't have to refer to the WaveOut.cs file whenever I want to initialize a WaveOut in code, or write a function which takes the actual &quot;DesiredLatency&quot; value and converts it into\r\n NAudio units.</p>\r\n",
