Thanks<br />\n</blockquote>\nI have integrated SoundTouch using some of the design elements from the PracticeSharp library. I was previously using the WaveOut driver before integrating Soundtouch, but the buffer size is calculated based on the WaveFormat and it was asking for too much audio. So, there was lots of gaps. Those gaps were not present when I had written each processed element to a file. I used the Wasapiout driver instead which appears to ask for less packets. Seemed to work well, but I still have issues with delayed audio feedback when I change bass/treble, etc because those occur before the resampling of data and not after. \r<br />\n<br />\nI am just curious if resampling the tempo prior to adjusting bass/treble, volume, left/right balance has any adverse affects oppose to doing it in the original wave format. <br />\n",
