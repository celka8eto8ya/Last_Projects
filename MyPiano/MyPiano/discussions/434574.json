    "Html": "You can take a look at the NAudioDemo-Project. It contains a live-audio-stream demo. Take a look at the code how the audio gets decoded. \r<br />\nYou will find out that there is a BufferedWaveProvider which stores the decoded raw audio and serves it to the playback-callback(hmmm funny word combination :D). \r<br />\n<br />\nYou need to calculate the FFT somewhere between the BufferedWaveProvider and the SoundOut itself because when the audiodata are in the BufferedWaveProvider it won't make any difference whether you playback a file or live-audio-stream. So first implement the buffering and decoding of the audio stream itself. After that you can continue with taking a closer look at the WPF-Demo application. There you can find a sample visualisation using a fft.<br />\n",
