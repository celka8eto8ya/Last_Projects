At the moment I use decimate function of Matlab for downsampling. <br />\n<br />\nAs far as I understand a IIR-Filter off order 4 (2*BiQuad) is applied. But when I use FIR of order 4 in matlab, the signals are not similiar as they should be.<br />\n<br />\nThe best result I got, was when doing the resampling with MediaFoundationResampler off quality 60 and a Chebyshev Type 1 off order 8 in Matlab. But there I have no Idea what kind off filter is applied in MediaFoundation.<br />\n<br />\nThx for helping me out.<br />\n",
