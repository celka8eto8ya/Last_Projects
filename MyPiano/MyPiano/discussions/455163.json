    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nthis might be a stupid question, but I've been stuck on it for the past few days : I need to get midi synth output on a separate input for stream post processing. Right now I've got my midi out connected to the built in windows midi synth and can get any midi sound I want. \r<br />\n<br />\nBut is there a way through naudio to get the output stream of midi out to say, plug it in a wave in? I know I can listen to a WasapiLoopbackCapture, but I need a stream containing exclusively midi output. Is it possible?\r<br />\n<br />\nI was also thinking of passing through a midi server like Timidity and routing my wave outputs through it, but it'd be a real pain to go through that, and I'd really enjoy doing it through naudio directly.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you have any input on that :)<br />\n",
