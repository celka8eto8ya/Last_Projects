    "Html": "Grass,\r<br />\n<br />\nYou are correct, MP3Gain uses ReplayGain, which is just a tag indicating how much to attenuate (or boost) the decoded audio to reach the specified average level.  The spec explains it pretty well (it's just some math), and at the end you should have a linear scaling factor (multiply each sample by scaling_factor to get the correct volume level).  Reading the ReplayGain tag is an exercise left to the reader (see the spec!).\r<br />\n<br />\nThe simplest way to support it is with a VolumeSampleProvider wrapper around the MP3 decoder.  Set the volume to the calculated scaling factor for each track and everything should &quot;just work&quot;.<br />\n",
