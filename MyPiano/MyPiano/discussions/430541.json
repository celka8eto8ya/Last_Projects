In practice, it turns out to be incredibly hard to work out exactly which control you need to adjust for your microphone. What I found was that code which worked\r\n on XP wouldn't work on Vista and above. More concerningly, the newer audio APIs (e.g. WASAPI) seem to offer less access to these type of parameters, with Microsoft preferring you to pop open the Windows sound control panel and let the user adjust the settings\r\n themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Have a look at my <a href=\"http://voicerecorder.codeplex.com/\">voice recorder</a> app which tries to set the microphone level.</p>\r\n",

WaveIn doesn't support really low latency though, but you might find you can get down to around 50ms.\r<br />\nYour method of amplifying the sound will only work up to a point. It risks overflow as you are staying in 16 bit mode. Normally I would convert the output of the buffered wave provider to float. Then you can freely amplify as much as you like. Then, before converting back down to 16 bit to play or write to a WAV file, you clip any samples that go outside the +/- 1.0 range.\r<br />\n<br />\nMark<br />\n",
