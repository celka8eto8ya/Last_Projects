Saw some reference to nullwavestream or something in an naudio post on here but it doesn't seem to exist</p>\r\n<p>i think i fixed the crash anyway - hasn't happened in days. Before i was resetting the stream.position to 0 if it got above 65000 because i thought a variable i was using to record the position might overflow, but it never seems to so i'm just letting it go on forever, so it might have been something to do with that.</p>",
