The issue is, it plays at two channel. So, if I specify 4 in the ChannelOffset, Dante Controller and Mixer shows channel 4 and 5 as active.\r<br />\nHowever, If I play a Mono wav file, only one channel is shown as active which is correct.\r<br />\nAlso, If I play stereo file using 'Reaper'(<a href=\"http://www.reaper.fm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reaper.fm/</a>) application, it plays at one channel.\r<br />\n<br />\nQuestions:\r<br />\n1- Is it the expected behaviour that a stereo file is played at two channel?\r<br />\n2- Is there a way in NAudio to play a stereo file to a single channel as in Reaper?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",
