It seems that e.Buffer is a Byte array... So how to move from this byte array to a float array ?<br />\n",

    "Html": "yes, this is a frustrating thing about designing APIs in C# as you can't just cast a byte array to a float array.\r<br />\nYou can either loop through using BitConverter.ToSingle on every four bytes, or you can use Buffer.BlockCopy to copy the entire e.Buffer into a float array. Finally if you are comfortable with unsafe code you can use pointers and loop through in C/C++ style.<br />\n",
