(latency won't be particularly great though - probably 200ms or so).\r<br />\n<br />\nFor smooth frequency transitions, you need to implement a glide/portamento algorithm, or there will be jumps in the sine wave. If you do a google search, you should find some discussion of algorithms. In the future I hope to write a blog-post on how to do this, as I have done something similar using wavetables in the past.<br />\n",
