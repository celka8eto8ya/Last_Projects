(WaveLab 6, MediaPlayer, Quicktime, etc.)</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestions why the header could be corrupt? (this is true for both 16/24-bit wave files)</p>\r\n<p>Regards Jonas</p>\r\n",

You would need to compare the WAV header created by NAudio, with one with the same format created by a different program that does play correctly in these programs. Then you can use the WaveFileReader to read both and see what the differences are.</p>",
