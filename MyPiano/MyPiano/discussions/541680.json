    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI have two RTP streams (one for each call direction) that I want to mix in a single WAV file.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe problem is that the two streams may use different codecs (and therefore different sampling frequency, encoding, etc...).\r<br />\n<br />\nIs it possible to store the two RTP streams in a WAV file using two channels (i.e. stereo)? Asked differently, is there a way to store multiple channels with different encoding, sampling frequency, etc?\r<br />\n<br />\nIf not, what do you recommend me?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks, Mickael<br />\n",
