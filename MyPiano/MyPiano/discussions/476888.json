What i actually have in my mind is to use a sample .wav piano sound and ascend/descend the tone by altering its frequency. However, I have no idea how to do so. \r<br />\n<br />\nI'm new to audio programming and I really wish you guys can guide me on this so I really wish you guys could give me some guide on this.
