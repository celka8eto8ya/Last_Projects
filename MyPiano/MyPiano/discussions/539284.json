I'd imagine this would be possible to automate.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Thanks again Mark.  I think I have this solved by creating a wav file in my DAW that emits a watermark every 10 seconds for 10 minutes, and then I created my own MixingWaterMarkProvider that mixes the source + watermark wav, and then stops reading once the first source is finished.  \n<br />\n<pre><code> if (samplesRead == 0)\n                    {\n                        sources.RemoveAt(1);\n                        sources.RemoveAt(0);\n                    }\n                    index--;</code></pre>\n\nI'm sure there's a more elegant way to do this in the code, but I'm not quite clever enough to figure it out yet.  Thanks again for creating this!  I'm amazed at how powerful Naudio is every time I use it  - and a lot of fun too!  <br />\n",
