But now it seems to me it's kind of hardcoded to 16 bits WAV files (as it read 2 byte samples independent on file type).\r<br />\n<br />\nAre there any better samples for that? I looked at WPF sample but didn't found the place where the low-level magic happens yet (I see only glossy WPF controls and bindings for now).<br />\n",

I always just build by own waveform control for new projects, as I've found that the requirements vary dramatically. \r<br />\n<br />\nI hope to blog about how to do this at some point in the future. I have an upcoming pluralsight course in which I'll be building a waveform rendering control.
