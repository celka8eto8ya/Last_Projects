    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm using WasapiCapture and have the following issue: during recording, it happens sometimes that my application freezes up for a few seconds. So the audio data that I receive in the DataAvailable gets stored up, and after the freeze I receive old data from the microphone. Is it possible that in case of a freeze I reset the wasapiCapture's buffer, or to drop those data packets that are far behind in time?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nIstvan <br />\n",

    "Html": "hi, not sure that will be very easy to do. It depends on what is causing the freezing.\r<br />\nYou'd need to make your own copy of the WasapiCapture code and write some custom logic to handle the case when you detect a freeze.<br />\n",
