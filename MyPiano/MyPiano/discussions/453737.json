Let's say I have a wav file, or a raw .DAT( 16bit Stereo) that has cues embedded in it. How could I read those cues and display them in a listbox, or something simple:\r<br />\nMessagebox.show(mycuelist)\r<br />\nI would be willing to make a small donation for an example.\r<br />\nThanks, Wyatt<br />\n",
