When I try to access the MMDevice.ID property an System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalDirectiveException is thrown (Message: &quot;Marshaler restriction: Excessively long string.&quot;). After some googling I'm stuck because I cannot find a failure in the NAudio COM interop definition. May this be caused by a buggy sounddriver? However it fails with any audio endpoint installed in my system. Is there a possibility to work around accessing the devices ID? Basically I only want to access the devices ID to determine which one of the devices the deviceenumerator returned is actually my default device.</p>\r\n<p>Your help is greatly appreciated</p>\r\n<p>Stefan Hoffmeister</p>",
