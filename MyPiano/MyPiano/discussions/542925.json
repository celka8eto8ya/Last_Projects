NAudio will call WaveOutPrepareHeader internally for you,\n        'but keep in mind, that NAudio needs the COMPLETE WaveFile at this point including the header. So DONÂ´T set a position here!\n\n        WaveStream.Position = 2000000 'Now you can specify a position in your WaveStream.\n        'Alternatively use &quot;WaveStream.seek(2000000,SeekOrigin.Begin)&quot; here.\n\n        WaveOut.Play() 'Let NAudio play the stream. It will do the tricky work for you, including callback, writing the audio blocks with\n        'WaveOutWrite and enqueing them using several buffers to recieve a fluent playback.\n    End Sub\n\nEnd Class</code></pre>\n\nBest regards\r<br />\n<br />\nFreefall<br />\n",
