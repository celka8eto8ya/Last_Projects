You create a private thread here - so no chance to use it.<br />\n<br />\nNot easy to fix this, but to fire an event at the beginning and/or end of your while loop in the seperate thread would be helpful. (Give me the chance to cache it)<br />\n<br />\nEDIT: An option for the thread priority should be helpful because i have problems when some system steps interupts the audio player a bit(thats why i use direct sound - just click on context desktop menu/refresh cause a hang in Naudio::waveout device)<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
