(attribute)</li>\n<li>\n.ctor(string) w/ exception for invalid file, bool TryLoad(string), or bool CheckSignature(byte[])?  (CheckSignature, but it's harder to implement)<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIn any case, it would be simple to implement as a set of generic methods in AudioFileReader (i.e., AddCodec&lt;T&gt;() where T : ICodecReader, new()).<br />\n",
