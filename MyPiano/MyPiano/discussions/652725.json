    "Html": "I have previously used a circular capture buffer to sample audio using DirectSound. Is that functionality available in Naudio? Ideally I would like a 5 second circular buffer that I can &quot;dip&quot; into every 200mS. Occasionally the interval might be longer. Obviously I would need a pointer to the data that has arrived since the last time I checked it. In DirectSound I can use &quot;GetCurrentPosition&quot; of the capture buffer. Does Naudio support anything like that?\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks.\r<br />\n<br />\nPaul.<br />\n",
