I can't really figure out why, it seems pretty random. This error also occoures in the Demo!\r<br />\nMark if you want to look into this, i got a good reproduceable sourcecode you can look at :)\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Challenge:</strong>\r<br />\nIf you play a stream in VLC player, like this one:\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://onair.100fmlive.dk:80/100fm_live.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onair.100fmlive.dk:80/100fm_live.mp3</a>\r<br />\nunder MediaInformation, it somehow know that the station is called Radio100, where does it get that information from?\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Challenge:</strong>\r<br />\nIs it possible to know what song is playing at the moment? i guess not?<br />\n",
