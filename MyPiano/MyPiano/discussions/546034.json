There is a ticking sound in there and I do not know why !!! \r<br />\nI am trying to do a isochronic tones generator. but the  frequency is not coming out right. I run it in a fft so that is how I know.\r<br />\n<br />\nok here is my code: <br />\n<pre><code>\n                            if (counter2 &gt;= Beat)\n                            {\n                                for (int t = 0; t &lt; 10000; t++)\n                                {\n                                    wavefile.WriteSample(0F);\n                                    wavefile.WriteSample(0F);\n                                    \n                                }\n\n                                counter2 = 0;\n                            }\n                            else\n                            {\n                             \n                               wavefile.WriteSample((float)Math.Abs(Amplitude3 * (Math.Sin((Math.PI * n * (Frequency3/2) /44100D)))));\n                               wavefile.WriteSample((float)Math.Abs(Amplitude3 * (Math.Sin((Math.PI * n * (Frequency3/2) / 44100D)))));\n                                counter2 = counter2 + (1D / 44100D);     \n                            }\n                        }\n                        wavefile.Flush();\n                        wavefile.Dispose();\n                        file.Add(save1.FileName);</code></pre>\n\nI had ( Math.Sin(( 2*Math.PI * n * (Frequency3) /44100D) but I had to change it up... after running it in my FTT... it the Frequency was too hight .. I do not know why.. it was like double what it should be \r<br />\n<br />\nbut it is still off \r<br />\nthis is how it sounds:\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=CC8AF223519E2440!114&amp;authkey=!ADGTKdZEpF4F4Q4&amp;ithint=file%2c.wav\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=CC8AF223519E2440!114&authkey=!ADGTKdZEpF4F4Q4&ithint=file%2c.wav</a><br />\n",
