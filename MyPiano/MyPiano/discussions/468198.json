    "Html": "dear Sir,\r<br />\nFirst , thanks for the great support in this forum. and thanks for the great control as well.\r<br />\n<br />\nCurrently , i am trying to get sound from serial port as byte. the format of the coming sound is 8KHz , 16 bit , 1 channel. I need to collect the sound and after serial port data is complete , it will save the data to a wav file (and to MP3 file later).\r<br />\nCurrently , i used this code\r<br />\n' 1---------------------------------------- initial declaration -------------------------\r<br />\n  Private Mywriter As WaveFileWriter  ' into class delclaration section\r<br />\n' 2----------------------------------------when need to start recording data from com port --<br />\n<pre><code> Mywriter = New WaveFileWriter(&quot;c:\\y1.wav&quot;, New WaveFormat())\n                AddHandler sPortSound.DataReceived, AddressOf PhoneSoundReceived</code></pre>\n\n' -3----------------------------------------------------- reading com port data ----------------\r<br />\n   Private Sub COMPortSoundReceived(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.IO.Ports.SerialDataReceivedEventArgs)<br />\n<pre><code>    Dim n As Integer = sPortSound.BytesToRead\n    Dim comBuffer As Byte() = New Byte(n - 1) {}</code></pre>\n\nsPortSound.Read(comBuffer, 0, n)<br />\n<pre><code>    If comBuffer.Length &gt; 0 Then\n        Mywriter.Write(comBuffer, 0, n)\n    End If</code></pre>\n\nend sub\r<br />\n' 4------------------------------- need to close recording and build file -------------------<br />\n<pre><code>                If Not IsNothing(Mywriter) Then\n                    Mywriter.Close()\n                    Mywriter = Nothing\n                End If\n\n\n</code></pre>\n\nproblem is that  is did not make part 4 , when closing the application , system crashes showing message &quot;&quot;Wavefilewriter was not disposed    at wavefilewriter.finalize() &quot;  , then this message disappears . However , the file is stored as pcm file (without header) , \r<br />\n<br />\nif I include section 4 , ie to close the wavefilewriter before close application , the program terminates easily without error , stored file is in wav format , , but the length is to much small , eg 0.5 second.\r<br />\n<br />\nplease advice.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks, <br />\n",
