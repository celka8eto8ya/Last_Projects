Yes it is MidiOutLongMsg, I've used it in a Visual C++ v6 program which I am trying to bring up to date with C# and .NET but as I said I am something of a beginner.</p>\r\n<p>I saw that in MidiInterop.cs there is a DllImport for ï»¿MidiOutLongMsg and I looked at the source for SysExEvent.cs but I'm afriad it was a bit beyond me. I was hoping there might be some notes or a tutorial on how to actually send a buffer using these calls?</p>\r\n<p>thanks</p>\r\n<p>PhilipJ</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Can a method be readily added to NAudio to simply send an array of raw byte values out the opened midi port?\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I cannot use NAudio, the C# Midi Toolkit (<a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6228/C-MIDI-Toolkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6228/C-MIDI-Toolkit</a>) is the only readily available managed MIDI library that I am aware of which supports SysEx.
