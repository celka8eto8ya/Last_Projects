Basically what I want is high quality audio <br>from a HTPC running Mediaportal. &nbsp;I intend to build a high quality audio DAC which is connected via ethernet and runs some dedicated protocol over UDP.</p>\r\n<p>The main challenge for me is to find a way to obtain a `bit perfect` audiostream from the player.&nbsp;<br>In this case I need some windows playback device which can be selected by audio players. I have no intention to write a windows device driver <br>and prefer to use c# .net</p>\r\n<p>Any possibilities with naudio to capture a media player audio stream directly, or maybe any other suggestion ?</p>\r\n<p>Thx,<br>Marcel</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
