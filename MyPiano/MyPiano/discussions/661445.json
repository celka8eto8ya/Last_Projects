In this book they will learn about: Isochronic tones, Binaural beats, and Monaural beats and how to code them. Then they will be able to come up with their own beats. They will learn about sound waves and a lot more.\r<br />\nThere are very few books / websites that show people how to code DSP tools. There are a lot that show the theory but not many that show the application, so I think this Book would be very useful for high school students, college students, and inter level employees.<br />\n",
