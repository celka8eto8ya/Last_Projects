    "Html": "Apologies for being so vague. This is what I would like to do: Analyze each sample in a wav file. For each sample, I want to get its position while additionally performing an FFT or autocorrelation on it. So if the audio file is 1 minute in duration and I know there is a Middle C in there, I want to find its start or onset time (in milliseconds). Or I might like to find the onset for another primary frequency in the audio. I know this is a difficult thing...\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm not playing or recording, just analyzing. Also, I just finished both Pluralsight classes. They were very helpful.\r<br />\n<br />\nBrandon<br />\n",

If (say) there are 44100 samples per second, then  to 44100th sample is at 1.0 seconds. \r<br />\nAlso you can't perform an FFT on an individual sample - you'd do it on a block of samples (say 512). \r<br />\nGlad you found the pluralsight courses helpful :) <br />\n",
