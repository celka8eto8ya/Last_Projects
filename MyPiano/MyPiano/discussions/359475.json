    "Html": "<p>You can do this with NAudio. The first step is usually to get the audio to floating point instead of 16 bit. Then you can amplify by a small amount (multiply each sample by a value &gt; 1). Then constrain to +/- 1.0 before going back to 16 bit just in case you have clipped.</p>\r\n<p>Another approach that is very good for speech is to use a compressor/limiter effect. This is a bit more advanced DSP-wise but can give excellent results. You are essentially reducing the peaks in the signal, so that you can amplify everything without clipping.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
