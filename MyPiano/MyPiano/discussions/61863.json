Perhaps there is some low level windows programming you could do to pick up the data before it has been overwritten but I've personaly not observed any implementations of that before.</p>\r\n<p>Could I ask what scenario you are trying to solve, where the stereo mix channel is not sufficient?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,<br>OpenSebJ</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
