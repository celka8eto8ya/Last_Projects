I'm playing the audio through a WaveOutEvent outputdevice.\r<br />\n<br />\nToday I tried adding support for WMA using NAudio.WindowsMediaFormat and got no sound. The wma files are reported as playing but nothing seems to happen. When changing the outputdevice to WaveOut instead of WaveOutEvent, wma files play normally.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any way to get wma to play through WaveOutEvent (I like the fact that it plays on a different thread)?<br />\n",
