I have MP3 file that i need to play using this format and write it to the COM port. I used the below code to get wave stream with the required format. <br />\n<pre><code>Dim reader As New Mp3FileReader(z.Text)\n    Dim downsampledStream As New WaveFormatConversionStream(New WaveFormat(8000, 16, 1), reader)\n    Dim alawStream As New WaveFormatConversionStream(WaveFormat.CreateALawFormat(16000, 1), downsampledStream)\n\n</code></pre>\n\nNow I need to send only pcm data  to the serial port (no wav header) , I need to play it by sending bytes count to serial port and wait for a certain interval based on this format.<br />\n 1- how to get the data to be sent from this stream ?\r<br />\n 2- how many bytes to read each time which represent a sample\r<br />\n 3- how long shall I wait before sending the next step.\r<br />\n 4- do i really need to convert mp3 to wav. it seems logic to me that playing MP3 itself include a decompressor and real time conversion to PCM that will be send to the output device, Can I capture send output device and make it a certain COM port ?\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThanks, <br />\n",
