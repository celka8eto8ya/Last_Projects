    "Html": "Hello,<br />\n<br />\nI hope someone with a little firmer grasp of c# can enlighten me here.  I have imported the NAudio library into Unity and it has brought me much success with MIDI.  However, I am now trying to get access to a device output.  This involves a call to MMDeviceEnumerator:<br />\n<pre><code> public MMDeviceEnumerator()\n {\n       if (System.Environment.OSVersion.Version.Major &lt; 6)\n       {\n           throw new NotSupportedException(&quot;This functionality is only supported on Windows Vista or newer.&quot;);\n        }\n        _realEnumerator = new MMDeviceEnumeratorComObject() as IMMDeviceEnumerator;\n\n}</code></pre>\n\nThe class constructor fails with a NullReferenceException inside Unity on the cast at the bottom.  I am not familiar with Interfaces and I feel this is causing Unity to fall over?<br />\n<br />\nAny help!?<br />\n",
