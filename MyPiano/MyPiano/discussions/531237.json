I can't test this myself because it's a remote user using a cheap USB soundcard that I suspect might be freezing up but can't be positive.\r<br />\n<br />\nDoes WaveOut default to DeviceNumber=0, the default windows playback device?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe code is basically like this. It's in a Try clause and does not throw an exception.\r<br />\n<br />\nWaveOut outputDevice  = new WaveOut()\r<br />\noutputDevice.DeviceNumber = 1;    // 1 = the frozen sound card device\r<br />\n<br />\nUsing NAudio 1.6\r<br />\nBTW, is there a What's New in NAudio 1.7 readme anywhere?<br />\n",
