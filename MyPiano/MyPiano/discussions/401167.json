How would you feel about expanding NAudio's support of DMO to determine what audio items\r\n can be encoded/decoded using DMO? From there we would move on to video decoding. I recognize that's a significant jump in scope but would love the ability to decode video frames the same way NAudio does MP3 frames currently. No visual video rendering would\r\n be needed (as I would intend to use WriteableBitmapEx, etc.) Thoughts?</p>\r\n",

Both of these took ages, and I struggled to find the information I wanted on how they were supposed to be used. I'd love for NAudio to be able to offer you the ability to use any DMO installed on your system (and also there is now MFT as well). However, I am not currently working on this, but I am open to contributions in this area.</p>",
