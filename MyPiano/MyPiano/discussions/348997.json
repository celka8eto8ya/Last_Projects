It takes the line in wave from a radio tuner and I want to route that via bluetooth to the car head unit.</p>\r\n<p>If I&nbsp;use the onboard Windows 7 settings I cannot convince the line in- wave to be routed via bluetooth. No matter what I set it always uses the analog speaker output and I have some ground loop noise on that which&nbsp;explains&nbsp;why&nbsp;I would\r\n like to use bluetooth. For reasons I don't know the bluetooth headset output waveform is fixed at 48 kHz, 2 channels, 16 bit.</p>\r\n<p>Is there an easy way to solve this, maybe with the waveIn, waveMixerStream32 and waveOut classes?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your attention.</p>\r\n",
