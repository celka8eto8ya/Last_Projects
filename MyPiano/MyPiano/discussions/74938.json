The NAudioDemo project gives you the chance to choose ASIO playback on the playback form, but it doesn't currently work with all soundcards.</p>\r\n<p>As for low latency, the best you are likely to get with NAudio would be to use WASAPI. You have to also bear in mind that since all .NET applications use a garbage collector, you will never get the really low latencies you can use in C/C++</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
