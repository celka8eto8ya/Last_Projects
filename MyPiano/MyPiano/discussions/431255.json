I do think that some of the midiStream APIs can do it, but the wrappers for them in NAudio are only partially\r\n complete.</p>\r\n<p>If you're making your own synth, then you'd probably be implementing the sequencer yourself anyway as it wouldn't appear to Windows as a MIDI device. The drum machine demo I added to the NAudio WPF Demo project might point you in the right direction for\r\n doing this. However, drums are usually &quot;one-shot&quot; whilst other MIDI notes must respond to the note-off message at the right time.</p>\r\n",
