Do I understand right that AsioSampleType is the same as bit depth of my soundcard?<br />\nIf yes, is it possible to get an AsioSampleType not in the AudioAvailable method?<br />\n<br />\nThe essence of my problem: In description of my soundcard says that one supports 24-bit and 32-bit, but that can't be changed in control panel of soundcard. I tried to change it in WIndows audio settings (deffault is 24-bit), but it automacally changing to deffault state (24-bit). AsioSampleType return Int32LSB and I have to manipulate with 32-bit audio, because only that works well. So, I can't undarstand anything. <br />\n",
