Do you think this can be achieved ?\r<br />\n<br />\nMy application is time sensitive and I really need to know the current position of the audio file with precision (100 ms of delay would be acceptable). How many time it should take to write and read this data in Memory Shared File ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you<br />\n",
