They initialize two tones before the actual message is broad casted. The tones are 352.7 and 345.6, I am assuming this is a frequency. I already have some code written to do the recording but I only want to kick off the actual writing method when these tones are heard. Can NAudio listen for this type of frequency and what are the classes for me to look into? If not are there other library's that can help me do this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Steven Combs</p>",

I have ported the code in the link above to C#, and if anyone wants I could clean it up and upload it somewhere. Maybe it could even be put in NAudio.</p>",
