    "Html": "Hi, I need to make an online sound processor in ASP.NET, and I decided to use NAudio for my project. However, I have some problems with visualization of waves. The class &quot;WaveViewer&quot; is written only for windows forms, it uses onPaint method, but PaintEventArgs are not supported in ASP.NET. Is it possible to make this class work somehow in my web application, and if not, does anyone have any idea how could I do this in some other way?\r<br />\nI'm relatively new to sound processing, so every help is appreciated.\r<br />\nThanks...<br />\n",
