I have chosen the DirectSoundOut Api for the output device because of less latency as against the WaveOut device. I have already the device number for my output device. But how can I select with the device number (index) the output device ?\r<br />\n<br />\nIt must be like this:<br />\n<pre><code>waveOut = new DirectSoundOut(outDeviceNumber);</code></pre>\n\nbut it doesn't work.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards, \r<br />\nLestan<br />\n",
