Basically this code:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\"><pre>\tWaveIn waveInStream;\r\n\tWaveFileWriter writer;\r\n\twaveInStream = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> WaveIn(44100,2);\r\n\twriter = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> WaveFileWriter(outputFilename, waveInStream.WaveFormat);\r\n\twaveInStream.DataAvailable &#43;= <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> EventHandler&lt;WaveInEventArgs&gt;(waveInStream_DataAvailable);\r\n\twaveInStream.StartRecording();\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>It works perfectly and record every sound on the system. The problem arises when I pluck in a headset (not usb, just directly into the headset jack on the built in soundcard on my laptop). This has the effect that any sound I can hear in the headset is not\r\n recorded. I think it has something to do with which device i am recording from, but I can't quite figure it out.</p>\r\n<p>I am trying to record a conversation, which means I would like to record the sound that comes from the mic and the sound I can hear in the headset at the same time.<br>\r\nCan someone point me in the right direction for this? Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>Btw, this is a cross post from stackoverflow (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670463/naudio-recording-from-headset\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670463/naudio-recording-from-headset</a>)&nbsp;where no one seems able to answer...</p>\r\n",
