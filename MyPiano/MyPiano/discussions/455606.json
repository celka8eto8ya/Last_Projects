The wav is then played only the duration and the rest is cut off. <br />\nI can draw the waveform of the entire wav no problem, and for the smaller duration I thought I could just change the length of the wavestream like so:<br />\n<pre><code>WaveDrawer wd = new WaveDrawer();\nwd.WaveStream = new NAudio.Wave.WaveFileReader(lr.URL);\nTimeSpan ts = (_representedObject as MediaObject).Duration;\nwd.WaveStream.SetLength((long)(wd.WaveStream.WaveFormat.AverageBytesPerSecond * ts.TotalSeconds));\nwd.FitToScreen(RectSingleLoop.Width);\n....</code></pre>\n\nBut this results in the exception &quot;Can't set length of WaveFormatString&quot;.<br />\nWhat am I doing wrong? Or is there another way to go about this?<br />\n<br />\nThank you!<br />\n",

I'd probably create a wrapper WaveStream with a shorter duration, whose Read method passes into the full WaveFileReader, but doesn't read more than the specified length. Have a look at OffsetSampleProvider for an idea of how this would be implemented.<br />\n",
