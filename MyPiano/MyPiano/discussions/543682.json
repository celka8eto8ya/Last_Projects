But what if, you already have the file as a stream (ex.  a MemoryStream). For ex. read in using a restful http service (not using NAudio classes). \r<br />\n<br />\nHow do I use that stream with the NAudio classes to play it?\r<br />\n<br />\nFurthermore, is there some safe technique to get information about waveformat, bitrate, etc. from the MemoryStream?<br />\n",
