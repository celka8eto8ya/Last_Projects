The problem is when I create waveprovider with 4 channels WaveOut.Init generates exeption &quot;WaveBadFormat calling waveOutOpen&quot;. 2 channels are OK. Does the\r\n NAudio support any number of channels or there is a limitation?</p>\r\n",

How about trying DirectSound or WASAPI. In an ideal world I would say ASIO, but unfortunately the ASIO support in NAudio is unreliable at the moment.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
