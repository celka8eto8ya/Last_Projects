I am hoping he might have time to trouble-shoot it a bit later this year, although I will do some experimenting of my own if I get the chance. I have a couple of Line 6 TonePort interfaces that don't work with it, so I am hopeful I will at least be able to get that working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark<br>\r\n",
