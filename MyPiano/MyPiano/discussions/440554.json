And you never explained  how to connect sampleProvider to waveOut.<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\n<br />\nSeb<br />\n",

Look at the code to see how it does it\r<br />\n<br />\nTo a filewriter - you cold use WaveFileWriter.CreateWaveFile (and CreateWaveFile16 which takes a sampleprovider)\r<br />\n<br />\nThere are several classes in NAudio that go from WaveProvider to SampleProvider and vice versa. Look at Pcm16ToSampleProvider, SampleToWaveProvider, SampleToWaveProvider16. For NAudio 1.7 I am planning to include some extension methods on both IWaveProvider, ISampleProvider and WaveOut which will simplify switching between the two audio stream representations.<br />\n",
