    "Html": "Hi, Im using the NAudio driver in an multi-track loop application I'm building.\r<br />\nIncidentally, I'm using a customized class implementing ISampleProvider, which is a sort of combination of a pan provider and volume provider in the same class, and also adds a &quot;Normalizing&quot; factor to normalize the audio.\r<br />\n(Each track has its own instance of this &quot;CustomSampleProvider&quot;, and each is then added to a MixingSampleProvider, which is used to initialize a WaveOut which is then played.)\r<br />\n<br />\nEssentially, it all works fine, except for one little issue which is audible clicking sounds only when the values for volume or pan are changed (values being provided by a slider and rotating knob).\r<br />\nTo be clear, the clicks only occur while the slider or knob is being adjusted.  Once the new values are set, there is no more noise.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm sure my PC is not the problem (my system is Win7 on a i7-2600 3.6GHz machine)\r<br />\nNow , I thought it might be my customized code, or something to do with the GUI, but then I tried using the NAudio FadeInOutSampleProvider as is, and I find I'm getting the same clicking during programmed fade ins/fade outs (for example, 2 seconds or longer).\r<br />\n<br />\nMy CustomSampleProvider Read method simply does this:<br />\n<pre><code>     buffer(System.Math.Max(System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment(outIndex), outIndex - 1)) = lpan * Me.sourceBuffer(n) * (m_volume * NormFactor)\n            buffer(System.Math.Max(System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment(outIndex), outIndex - 1)) = rpan * Me.sourceBuffer(n) * (m_volume * NormFactor)</code></pre>\n\n(in other words, nothing too fancy, just multiplying by a pan factor, volume factor and normalizing factor)\r<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas why the clicking occurs when the values are being changed?<br />\n\r<br />\nMichael<br />\n",
