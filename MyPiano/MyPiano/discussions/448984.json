I have found/created some code which can detect if the level has gone above a certain threshold, but can't figure out how to count the number of times it has risen above that threshold reliably. the sound/noise is being created by a switch which is connected to the microphone, every time it switches a noise is created by the switching. Do I need to use some sort of filtering?\r<br />\nSteve.<br />\n",
