How can I send such stream just as if it was comming from a capture device?<br />\n",

I just need to know how to make this work with a WaveStream/WaveMixerStream32 as it contains the whole audio stream instead of smaller packets. Is there a way of packetizing the audiostream into smaller chunks? How to choose the right chunk size? <br />\n",
