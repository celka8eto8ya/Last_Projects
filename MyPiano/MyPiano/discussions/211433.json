Thanks for the greay library!</p>\r\n<p>Although, I'm having trouble figuring out how to display a waveform in my windows form app. I don't need anything special like zooming in or displaying live data while playing/recording. Just want to&nbsp;open a wave file and display a&nbsp;static waveform of it.</p>\r\n<p>I followed the first tutorial you have (which works)&nbsp;and then added a waveform control. I then replaced the waveOutDevice.Play(); (I don't need to play the audio for this)&nbsp;line with waveViewer1.WaveStream = mainOutputStream;. I see the control in my app and it appears to be trying to render something, but its malformed. I'm guessing I'm not using the control right, maybe some properties I need to set? I tried the .DrawToBitMap method but it rendered the same image.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any help!</p>",
