I open same wav file by OpenFileDialog - It's Ok, Then read data from wav file and convert them to float, then I apply my function for effecting that samples, and conver them to byte[] and read - and now start the problem when the stream of effected data is in DirectSoundOut - I can't hear fluent, effected sound but it sounds like one sample is played more times, its change when i change latency, but if I've got small latency, I can't hear sound and when I  raise latency, I've got problem, which I described above.\r<br />\nI think, It becase:\r<br />\n1) This process is to time-consuming, and data are not being processed in this time, becase my function for effecting is transfer function, which can be variable in time - you got graph of this function and you can change possition of points of this graph and on this point is applied polynomial regression to get function with parametr, this method I call in Read method and fit samples to the equation. \r<br />\n2) I can't found the best latency...<br />\n<pre><code>        private BlockAlignReductionStream stream = null;\n        private NAudio.Wave.DirectSoundOut output = null;\n        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            OpenFileDialog open = new OpenFileDialog();\n            open.Filter = &quot;Wave File (*.wav)|*.wav;&quot;;\n            if (open.ShowDialog() != DialogResult.OK) return;\n            textBox1.Text = open.FileName;\n            WaveChannel32 wave = new WaveChannel32(new WaveFileReader(open.FileName));\n            EffectStream effect = new EffectStream(wave);\n            stream = new BlockAlignReductionStream(effect);\n            output = new DirectSoundOut();\n            output.Init(stream);\n            output.Play();\n            button2.Enabled = true;\n            chart1.Enabled = true;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\nthis is part of code, where I try to open file and play effected file<br />\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code> public float getFunction(float x)\n        {\n           double[] arrayX = new double[chart1.Series[0].Points.Count()];
