This was some time ago, maybe even a year or more, and I haven't noticed any changes to it since. I'm really interested in NAudio. Would someone be willing to make a tutorial for us\r\n noobs?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",

I'm afraid I haven't done much on MIDI but I will bear it in mind for future blog posts. The best thing for now is to look at the source code for the NAudioDemo which contains simple working examples of NAudio in action.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
