This soundcard has got two channels â€“ left and right. Is there a way to specify in code which channel you are taking the audio from and which channel you are outputting the audio back onto the soundcard? So for instance would it be easy to specify taking audio off the left channel only and then outputting audio onto the right channel only? <br />\n",
