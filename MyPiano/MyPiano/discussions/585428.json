I thought about splitting my chore into two phases: \r<br />\n<br />\n1) Making a spectrogram visualizer\r<br />\n2) Reading somehow information from a .wav file to find the peaks\r<br />\n<br />\nCan you help me with this chores? Maybe if you could just lead me on how to read data from the .wav file in order to find the magnitude, frequency and time I could understand better how to accomplish my goal.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",
