Currently, I must place the file I want to play in the path: &quot;C:\\Users\\VoodooSixTwo\\Desktop\\TestProject\\bin\\Debug&quot;.  This works perfectly, however, I want to instead play a file from a folder in the bin folder (i.e. &quot;C:\\Users\\VoodooSixTwo\\Desktop\\TestProject\\bin\\Debug\\Sounds&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nIs AudioFileReader hard coded to play files from the bin\\Debug folder?<br />\n<br />\nI am using the FireandForgetEngine and calling the action:<br />\n<pre><code>   FireAndForgetAudioSample.AudioPlaybackEngine.Instance.PlaySound(&quot;song.mp3&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n\nAny assistance is greatly appreciated.<br />\n",
