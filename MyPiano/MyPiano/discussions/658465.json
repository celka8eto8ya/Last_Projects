    "Html": "Hi all, I am new to NAudio so I apologize in advance for my ignorance. I was testing around just getting an MP3 file to play and I am having a difficult time.\r<br />\n<br />\nHere is my code:\r<br />\n<br />\nusing NAudio.Wave;\r<br />\nnamespace ConsoleApplication2\r<br />\n{<br />\n<pre><code>class Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        WaveOutEvent waveOut = new WaveOutEvent();\n        WaveStream mp3Reader = new Mp3FileReader(&quot;e:\\\\wonka.mp3&quot;);\n        waveOut.Init(mp3Reader);\n        waveOut.Play();\n        mp3Reader.Dispose();\n        waveOut.Dispose();\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n}\r<br />\n<br />\nSo when I run that code nothing happens at all but I notice for a split second in the volume mixer the application appears as if it is starting to do something and then it vanishes. I have verified that I can play the file e:\\wonka.mp3 in a lot of other ways.\r<br />\n<br />\nI also had one other question while I am here. Is it possible to pass an audio &quot;file&quot; directly to NAudio from a byte[] rather than writing it to disk first and then passing it to the reader?<br />\n",
