As the glitch happens right there, i can't do a FadeIn or FadeOut to solve the little artifacts of the stop or play. I've tried with WaveOut, Wasapi, and DirectSound.\r<br />\n<br />\nA very simple player:<br />\n<pre><code>reader = new AudioFileReader(&quot;test.mp3);\n\nwaveOut = new WaveOut();\nwaveOut.DeviceNumber = 0;\nwaveOut.NumberOfBuffers = 2;\nwaveOut.DesiredLatency = 150;\nwaveOut.Init(reader)\nwaveOut.Play()</code></pre>\n\nLater, right when i call waveOut.Stop(), the click happens.\r<br />\n<br />\nI thought it was only my system, but the app on other computers does the same.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you.<br />\n",
