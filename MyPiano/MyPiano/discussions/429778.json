Programmatically I will have to determine which is which as the length of each\r\n and time in-between can fluctuate. My question is, what would be the best way to parse the input stream to check for differences in amplitude. There is bound to be some background noise so the input would be a low value then go high possibly with a leading\r\n spike. this high level would be maintained and then drop to a low value again. Any pointers on what commands I could use to monitor the stream of values?</p>\r\n",
