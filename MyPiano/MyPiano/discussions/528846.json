    "Html": "I usually do things like this as extension methods to start with in my own applications, and only move them into NAudio if I think it is going to be useful to a lot of people. The demo apps have a lot of code like this, waiting to be promoted into NAudio, so the ACM code enumeration page maybe could showcase this feature.\r<br />\n<br />\nBTW I did a trial of your MediaFoundationReader changes today. Unfortunately I was on a Windows 7 dev machine, so the playing from stream doesn't work. It's a shame it seems to be so hard, but I'd really like to have at least Win 7 support in there. I've got some attempts of my own creating a managed implementation of IMFByteStream, but it is currently going wrong with the IMFAsyncCallback implementation.\r<br />\n<br />\nI might just pull your ACM fixes in for now, and come up with a future plan of how we can get MF stream reading support (I do have another fallback option which I hope to blog about soon).<br />\n",
