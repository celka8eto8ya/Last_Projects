I need to send the bytes in sequence in order to be heared by the receipient phone. the needed format is  signed 16bit PCM 8000 Hz file. I have made some success by sending the PCM itself \r<br />\n<br />\n   Dim fileByte() As Byte = My.Computer.FileSystem.ReadAllBytes(&quot;c:\\k29.pcm&quot;)\r<br />\n   Dim n As Integer = 16 / 2\r<br />\n   For x As Integer = 0 To fileByte.Length - n - 1 Step n<br />\n<pre><code>sPortSound.Write(fileByte, x, n)</code></pre>\n\nNext\r<br />\n<br />\nno , I need to play MP3 directly to serial port. I need to get the PCM bytes , and send it to the serial port. I guess that MP3 file reader class will open the MP3 file and decompress to PCM. Am I right , in this case how to loop through bytes to send it to the serial port.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease assume that the recorded MP3 is compressed from PCM file that is 16 bit,8KHz, so we do not need to convert file to the required sampling &amp; bit rate.\r<br />\n<br />\n Thanks for support<br />\n",

I still want to confirm with you that :-<br />\n<ul>\n<li>the code above , the MP3FileReader will read the MP3 file and converts it to PCM data ?</li>\n<li>\nhow do i determine the chunk size ? and on which interval I should send it to the serial port. when i determine the MPRFilerReader properties , it shows the the loaded file format  is {16 bit PCM: 16kHz 2 channels}. May be it is 2 channel and I am send both channels. How can I split data for one channel , and read the other , or can i combine both into one channel and send to the serial port ?<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nCan I send you the MP3 file to play with ?<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",

    "Html": "Yes, MP3FileReader emits PCM from its Read method\r<br />\nThe chunk size will depend entirely on what the device on the other end of your serial port is expecting. \r<br />\nTo convert stereo to mono, you can discard a channel or mix them together. There are StereoToMono classes in NAudio that will help you do this. If you have access to Pluralsight, watch the &quot;Changing Audio Formats&quot; of <a href=\"http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/audio-programming-naudio\" rel=\"nofollow\">this course</a>, in which I go into a lot of detail about how to do this.<br />\n",
