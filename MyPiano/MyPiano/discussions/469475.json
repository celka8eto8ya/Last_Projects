I need to get the amplitude at a certain frequency , , eg get amplitude at 3KHz.  I really appreciate if you can write some code .\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks so much for your support :) .<br />\n",

You really will need to learn a few things about how FFTs work first though, and this can take some time as they are a more advanced mathematical technique.\r<br />\n<br />\nI write a bit about FFT with NAudio in this article: <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/AutotuneNET\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/AutotuneNET</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, the visualisation module in my PluralSight course (not free I'm afraid), explains more about FFTs <a href=\"http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/audio-programming-naudio\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/audio-programming-naudio</a>\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMark<br />\n",
