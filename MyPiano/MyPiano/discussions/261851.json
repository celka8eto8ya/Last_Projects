    "Html": "<p>It's because not all implementers of IWavePlayer can or will be able to support volume changes. If you are happy just using WaveOut then ignore the IWavePlayer interface and use Volume on WaveOut. Just include an IWaveProvider/ISampleProvider/WaveStream in your audio pipeline that supports modifying the volume. This gives you the added flexibility of boosting the volume beyond 100% if you need to (although remember to clip before sending to the soundcard).</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
