I can modify the notes. but this, i'm stuck with.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm thinking either 1) modify the existing midi event, or delete that midi event, and create a new one and replace it....but i can't seem to find where I specify what the track name would be.\r<br />\n<br />\nany one have any idea what the process is for that?\r<br />\n<br />\nthanks!<br />\n",
