    "Html": "<p>you should be doing your waveOutStream Init and Play outside the loop, and use a BufferedWaveProvider to feed wave out. Inside the loop, you shuold put the data received into the BufferedWaveProvider.</p>\r\n<p>Also, from your code, it looks like you are on a background thread so I recommend using WaveOutEvent instead of WaveOut for playback.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
