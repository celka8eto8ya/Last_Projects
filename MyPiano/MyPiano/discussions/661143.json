Recording with &quot;asioOut.InitRecordAndPlayback&quot; with &quot;asioOut.InputChannelOffset = 8&quot; is no Problem. But Playback only with Marshal.Copy to direct to the Output Buffer does not work. I think because &quot;asioOut.InputChannelOffset = 8&quot; only works for Recording. Is there a Solution / Workaround?\r<br />\n<br />\nJens<br />\n",

Now I heard a Sound, but very distortet. I don't understand that, because recording and playback works without a Problem.<br />\n",
