I want to built a c# applicaion which takes skype calls and transfers the audio bidirectional to a capi call.\r<br />\n<br />\nTaking the call and dailing capi runs well but I don't know how to resample audio from 16 kHz, 16 bit, mono (Skype) to and from 8 kHz, 8 bit, mono.\r<br />\n<br />\nI thought of two threads each reading async byte stream and converting it. But I'm not sure if this is a good solution??\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, hoping for hints and/or examples how to do this conversation stuff...<br />\n",
