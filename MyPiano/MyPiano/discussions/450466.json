Can you answer these questions:\r<br />\n<br />\nThe code i posted is from a method that i call every time i play a new file. So it disposes it all and reinitialize all of it. Is that wrong when i want to crossfade? i mean, should i reuse some of it?\r<br />\nThe reason that i get confused is that if i want to crossfade, i would have to add a stream into the mixingSampleProvider correct? but what about all the other code that touches the stream, like volume, mixereffect etc. \r<br />\n<br />\nI hope it makes sense ;)<br />\n",
