I got most of it working but I'm having a few issues. \r<br />\n<br />\nI noticed the Sample (Fire &amp; forget) on the Wiki with CachedSound and for the most part that was fine except how do I know when a SoundEffect or BGM has finished playing because for some SoundEffects/Songs I need to manage when they end as they are supposed to loop until a event triggers them not to.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso I have a collection of 3,864 songs and sounds and they all have different sample rates and MixingSampleProvider does not like that. Will I have to manually convert each mp3 to match?\r<br />\n<br />\nOther then that implementing NAudio has been pretty easy and pain free.<br />\n",

I usually implement a simple wrapper (decorator pattern) around my SampleProviders if I need to raise an event or do something special when the end is reached.
