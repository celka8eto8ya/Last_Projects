Then I can listen to it with Media Player, it's quite simple and effective.\r<br />\nI can mix drums (chanel 10) with Piano (chanel 1-9 and 11-15).\r<br />\nBut how can I play others instruments than piano?\r<br />\nI miss something like a command for selecting the defaut instrument to play on a specified chanel (for example guitar on chanel 1, organ on chanel 2...)\r<br />\nIs it possible to do that with NAudio, and if so, how to do it?\r<br />\nThank you.<br />\n",
