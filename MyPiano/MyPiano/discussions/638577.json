I'v read RawWaveSourceStream is the way to go, but i can't find the method inside the NAudio namespace nor any documentation about it online. <br />\n<br />\nUsing NAudio v.1.7. in combination with C# (Visual Studio 2013).<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\n<br />\nBastiaan<br />\n",

So you must tell the RawsourceWavestream which waveformat the data has, and it will read it for you.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers.<br />\n",
