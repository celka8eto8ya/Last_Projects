    "Html": "hm, not quite sure what your actual goal is...having never worked with MP3, however, looking at your code and wikipedia (for MP3) it looks like you MUX frames in time, that is 26ms of one song, then 26ms of the other and so forth....is that what you want? I dont know but I could imagine that might lead to strange output (-:  do you want to play those songs parallel? Then you have to setu a sample/wave provider chain (two input, one output) and write the output of that one into a file<br />\n",
