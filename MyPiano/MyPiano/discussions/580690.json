    "Html": "Hey all,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm fairly new to naudio and FFT. All I want to do is draw the waveform of the computer's speaker output (the same output I get peak volume with MMDevice.AudioMeterInformation.MasterPeakValue) to the screen. I've looked around google and everything is either poorly documented or windows forms or using about 9 million libraries. Is there any way to just draw the waveform to the screen in XNA? That's all I ask.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nP<br />\n",
