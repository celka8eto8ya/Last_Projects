It doesn't like me having called StartRecording(), and then StopRecording() within my AudioStart() method. Even though I was using a breakpoint to simulate time elapsed between them. I removed StopRecording, and let it run, the DataAvailable method fired, and my recording size started increasing.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your help. I think I should be sorted out :)<br />\n",
