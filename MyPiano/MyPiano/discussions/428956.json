I just updated it from NAudio 1.5 to NAudio 1.7 and so far it is mostly working.\r<br />\nQuestion 1 - The waveOutDevice.PlaybackStopped event changed signature in NAudio 1.6, but that was easily found and fixed. But now, if I manually Stop playback, the event is properly detected, but if the song reaches End-Of-File, the event is not raised/detected ( and the application restarts). In the past we had to use  mainOutputStream.PadWithZeroes = False to ensure we got an event on EOF. Is there a new trick?\r<br />\n<br />\nQuestion 2 -  I tried to play an AAC file and got an exception (of course - you said &quot;Windows 7 and above&quot;). My question is, should I use the MediaFoundationReader for WMA files? I.E. is it just the AAC files that need Windows 7, or is it the MediaFoundationReader?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nJake<br />\n",

Does your roadmap includes a future for WaveOutEvent? If so, and if you want me to look into it, just let me know where to look, for a starting point to get up to speed on that portion of the code.\r<br />\n<br />\nJake<br />\n",
