When i plot these points the resulting graph matches that of Audacity.</p>\r\n<p>My attempts to play the samples have resulted in sound with the correct rhythm but it sounds weird. I dont know of its my decoders fault or i dont play it in the correct way.</p>\r\n<p>So my question is: Assuming my decoder works, how should i continue with these float values?</p>\r\n<p>After 3 months of work i really want to know if it works haha</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n",

If nearly the whole wave contains mistakes you would not be able to find the bug quite easy. I thought about different things how to solve\r\n my problem but I ended up in reading line for line again and search for mistakes I made. If there is an opensource deocer(in my case there was no flac decoder) you could debug that decoder and compare results with your decoder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A very big problem is also if you just have very small &nbsp;mistakes in your wave. So you can use Audacity, zoom in and get the sample the mistake is. Now you can calculate the frame index where the error happens. Now you can debug start debugging there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But all in all. Debugging decoders is always very very hard because there is just such a huge amount of data and you have nothing more than numbers and bytes :(</p>\r\n<p>I really can feel with you... (by the way... I spent over 2 month debugging until everything worked fine :P)</p>\r\n",
