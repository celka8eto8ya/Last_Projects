I am still learning about bit depth and digital audio in general, but if the loopback records the buffer at 8 bit and you convert it to 16 bit doesn't that just increase the potential precision and not actually affect the information in the buffer?<br />\n",

And no inbuilt conversion is available.\r<br />\nAnd as for most applications, you probably don´t want Float, and 16 bit, or 24 bit.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo this converts it from Float 32bit to 16bit. So there is no benefit in terms of quality, there is probably less quality, but that´s inaudible probably.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf it were in 8 bit, it would be extremely noisy. 16 bit sounds clean and the noise floor is far below what´s audible. 8 bit however has noise no matter what, the noise floor is so high up, that it´s impossible to have any sound audible without hearing the noise probably, at least in all normal scenarios.<br />\n",
