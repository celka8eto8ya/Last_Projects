The library is&nbsp;written in C# using NAudio and SoundTouch library (C&#43;&#43;). It works quite nicely even at an early alpha. I decided to publish the sources today after\r\n this show stopper to allow you usage of the utility. This is a pretty good unit tester for NAudio ;)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/practicesharp/\">http://code.google.com/p/practicesharp/</a></p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Yuval</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n",
