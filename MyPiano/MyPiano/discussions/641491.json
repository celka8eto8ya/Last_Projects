I'd be very thankful if anybody could help me with it.<br />\nSo the situation is: I have to record microphone input in my app, then play it back through the audio output.<br />\nActually I am writing a Tox client and I am trying to play back the received audio frames, but you can see that the two things are almost identical. In case of Tox, I just receive the frames from the network, not from my mic. <a href=\"https://github.com/uruk/WinTox/blob/audio/WinTox/ViewModel/CallViewModel.cs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/uruk/WinTox/blob/audio/WinTox/ViewModel/CallViewModel.cs</a><br />\n<br />\nSo I made a simplified application to demonstrate my solution for the mic-to-output problem so far:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/uruk/NAudioTest/blob/master/NAudioTest/MainPage.xaml.cs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/uruk/NAudioTest/blob/master/NAudioTest/MainPage.xaml.cs</a><br />\n<br />\nIt works (after you give permission to the app to use your mic manually through the settings charm), but the audio played back is nowhere near my normal voice. What am I doing wrong?<br />\n<br />\nThanks for help in advance,<br />\nPeter<br />\n",
