When I play an audio, player repeats the last quarter second of the audio at the end of the audio.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn the AdvancedBufferedWaveProvider class, when the buffer is empty, I fire an event to stop the player, but even if I stop the player, the player repeats it.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you guys know what am I doing wrong? I can send my code if needed.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nNazmi<br />\n",
