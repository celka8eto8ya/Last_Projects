Currently I am using&nbsp; driver.createbuffer function to create the buffers. Second\r\n call of this funtion for creaing the second buffer is failing.</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if it is possible to play multiple wave files using ASIO.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

You could add that, or make a silence playing waveprovider (very easy to do - just implement IWaveProvider and zero out the buffer), which you connect to the inputs you want silent.</p>\r\n<p>My soundcard only has two outputs so I've never been able to test ASIO with higher channel counts. hope it works for you.</p>",
