This is to see if processing times are more efficient if each buffer is a smaller.\r<br />\n<br />\nCreateBuffers() in WaveIn seems to create the buffer size:\r<br />\nint bufferSize = BufferMilliseconds * WaveFormat.AverageBytesPerSecond / 1000;\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried changing WaveFormat.AverageBytesPerSecond but it is read-only.<br />\n",
