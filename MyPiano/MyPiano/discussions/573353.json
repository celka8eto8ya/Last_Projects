    "Html": "But what wave format is the device at the other end of the serial port actually expecting. Is it really 8 bit linear PCM? Or could it be mu or a -law?\r<br />\n<br />\nTo troubleshoot issues like this I recommend taking a divide and conquer approach. First, instead of sending your audio to the serial port, write it to a WAV file. Listen to the WAV file in Windows Media Player. Does it sound distorted or OK?\r<br />\n<br />\nThen create a simple voice recording at the format you plan to send to the serial port. Play that through the serial port by sending it's data a few hundred milliseconds at a time. Does that sound OK?\r<br />\n<br />\nBy answering these questions you will discover which part of the overall system isn't working correctly.<br />\n",
