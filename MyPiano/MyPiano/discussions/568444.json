    "Html": "Thanks for the reply, Mark. Device 0 is the Microsoft Synth and it plays just fine with the demo programs I ran. The only difference seems to be the demo programs run in a windows application like WPF or WinForms, and the code above is running in a console application. It may be possible that there is a threading issue of some type that is keeping MidiOut to play the MidiMessages sent to it.<br />\n",
