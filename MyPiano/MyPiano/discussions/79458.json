I've got an exception with the following message:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">Offset and length were out of bounds for the array or count is greater than the number of elements from index to the end of the source collection.</p>\r\n<p>The minimum example I could make that also throw that error didn't include WaveMixerStream32 at all with took me to the&nbsp;conclusion&nbsp;that the problem was in how I'm using WaveChannel32. The code is this:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:Blue\">var</span> audio = <span style=\"color:Blue\">new</span> WaveFileReader(OriginalAudioFileName);\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue\">var</span> audio32 = <span style=\"color:Blue\">new</span> WaveChannel32(<span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> WaveFileReader(OriginalAudioFileName));</pre>\r\n<pre>WaveFileWriter.CreateWaveFile(PublicAudioFileName + <span style=\"color:#A31515\">&quot;audio.wav&quot;</span>, audio);\r\nWaveFileWriter.CreateWaveFile(PublicAudioFileName + <span style=\"color:#A31515\">&quot;audio32.wav&quot;</span>, audio32);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>audio.wav is generated just fine. audio32.wav is 58 bytes and that line thrown the exception.</p>\r\n<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Also, you must remember to set audio32.PadWithZeroes = false before you call WaveFileWriter.CreateWaveFile or you will create an infinitely long WAV file (I might remove this requirement in future versions to save anyone else from making this mistake).</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
