I've browsed and search through the discussion board without finding an answer.</p>\r\n<p>I was wondering if someone could explain the function &quot;AcmMp3FrameDecompressor.DecompressFrame&quot; for me, what does it actually do?</p>\r\n<p>I have a mp3 stream coming in and I do as follow:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><pre><div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\"><pre><span style=\"color:blue\">using</span>(<span style=\"color:blue\">var</span> ms = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> MemoryStream(streamBuffer)\n{\n      <span style=\"color:blue\">var</span> frame = Mp3Frame.LoadFromStream(ms);\n      <span style=\"color:blue\">var</span> f = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> WaveFormat();\n      <span style=\"color:blue\">var</span> format = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> Mp3WaveFormat(frame.SampleRate,\n                        frame.ChannelMode == ChannelMode.Mono ? 1 : 2,          frame.FrameLength, frame.BitRate);\n\n      <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (decompress == <span style=\"color:blue\">null</span>)\n          decompress = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> AcmMp3FrameDecompressor(f);\n\n      decompressed = decompress.DecompressFrame(frame, buffer, 0);\n}</pre>\n</div>\n</pre>\n<br></pre>\r\n<p>What does the &quot;DecompressFrame&quot; actually give me? I'm after a way to convert the incoming mp3 stream into for example A-law format. Is this the correct way? I understand that in order to actually get A-law I have to later convert it to A-law format using\r\n &quot;WaveFormat.CreateALawFormat&quot;, but first I need to understand what I get from that function mentioned above.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

There's no music, only speech, so PCM is used by default in the software. I was hoping it was PCM coming from the DecompressFrame function, so that makes life alot easier for me :).</p>\r\n<p>Again, thank you for the response! I'll check out your article as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
