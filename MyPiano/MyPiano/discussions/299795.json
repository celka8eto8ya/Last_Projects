It's not only a simple conversion by picking samples depends from divide factor. I tried that\r\n and it gives extra noise in comparison with output from programs like GoldWave.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe u have any idea how to convert properly, minimizing noise (ex. form&nbsp;quantization)?</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>NAudio can resample using ACM, or with the DMOResamplerStream (if the DMO resampler COM object is on your box). I don't think either of them do filtering though so there is possibility of aliasing when downsampling. The BiQuadFilter was a very early addition to NAudio, and probably needs to be made into an IWaveProvider or ISampleProvider to make it more easily usable.</p>",
