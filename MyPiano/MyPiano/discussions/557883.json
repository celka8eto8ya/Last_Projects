It seems that the last soundbuffer just gets repeated.<br />\n<br />\nWhile normal music playback it looks like there is sound coming from both applications (my application and the music player). Actually there isn't any sound coming from my application, if i mute it there is no output difference on my headphones, but my application doesn't get any sound from the loopback.<br />\nThis looks like <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/EVAmAZh.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">this.</a><br />\n<br />\nWhen pressing stop or exiting the music player the last soundbuffer continues to play over and over until i exit my application. Looking into the volume control you can see <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/BDo8vSN.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>. The sound is coming from my application.<br />\n<br />\nI'm using Windows 7 x64.<br />\n<br />\nHow can i prevent this?<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bFS3dDnm1s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a video</a> to better show you whats the issue<br />\n<br />\nregards.<br />\n",
