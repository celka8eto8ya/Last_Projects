Once that panel is open, I can view the levels fine via my application. As soon as the panel is closed, I am unable to view the meter levels. The device state is set to &quot;Active&quot; as well. \r<br />\nI'm not sure if the device is automatically disabled when it's not &quot;activated&quot; or &quot;called&quot; from an application. Is there anyway that I can programmatically enable it? Or maybe I'm missing something?\r<br />\n<br />\nI access the levels via the normal method:\r<br />\n<strong>DevCol[cmbDevices.SelectedIndex].AudioMeterInformation.MasterPeakValue;</strong>\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help would be much appreciated.<br />\n",
