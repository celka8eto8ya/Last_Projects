    "Html": "Hi,<br />\n<br />\nfor a private software project, I am looking for a C# code able to receive many internet radio channels, decoding them to pcm  (to a bandwidth of say 5kHz)  and send the channels bundled as a live stream to an USB port. At the USB port is a FPGA which first separates the audio signal in their channels processes the signal further. Is NAudio able to this (I mean from internet to USB port)?<br />\n<br />\nI use Windows 8<br />\n<br />\nRegards<br />\nUrs<br />\n",
