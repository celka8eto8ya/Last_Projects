I have spent a while trying to get NAudio to register in the GAC, because when I add an NAudio component\r\n to my VST.NET GUI and then try to validate the outputted VST, I get an error that says &quot;Inner Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'NAudio ... ' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</p>\r\n<p>I added the DLL to the references folder in my project, but I had to manually add the components into the toolbox in visual studio. NAudio works fine in a separate project that is simply a WFA and not connected with VST.NET in any way (as I can run the project\r\n and mess with the controls and return values), but I'd really like to get it connected to VST.NET. I tried rebuilding the NAudio project for x64, as I saw that was a problem with other people, but I got the same result.</p>\r\n<p>If&nbsp;you have any suggestions for me on what I could do, let me know. I'm trying to make this work for my senior project, and if I need to create the controls myself, I&nbsp;can, but I really want to see if I can get NAudio to work for me first.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your help in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Jake</p>\r\n",
