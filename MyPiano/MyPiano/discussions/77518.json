    "Html": "<p>hi Nick,<br><br>NAudio can capture audio from a microphone. It cannot convert it to MP3, though, so you would probably need to use LAME.exe. You could use .NET to stream the converted MP3 over the network. You should be aware that latency will not be particularly good though (probably 100s of milliseconds before the converted audio will be heard). At the other end, there are ways of making NAudio play back MP3 from a network stream, but it is not built into the library yet<br> <br>Mark</p>",
