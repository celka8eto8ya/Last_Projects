In the service i read in the file as a WaveStream and then return it as a &lt;Stream&gt;.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe client receive this as a &lt;MessageBodyStream&gt;. How do I play this stream on the client using NAudio? \r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\n<br />\nPONDEV<br />\n",

And as you suggest, then I should write the WaveStream to the bufferedWaveProvider on the client side?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..or do I first need to write the WaveStream to a MemoryStream and return it from the wcf service. Then writing the memorystream to BufferedWaveProvider on the client?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>\r\n<hr id=\"stopSpelling\">\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
