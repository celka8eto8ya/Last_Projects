At the same time I need to mix these 16 channels together (Mono) and stream the mix to the monitor out (headphone out) of the sound module.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have suceeded in doing one OR the the other, thus either streaming to the 16 outputs OR streaming the mix, but not both...\r<br />\n<br />\nWhats the best way to do this?<br />\n",
