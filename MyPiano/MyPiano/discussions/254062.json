Mono and stereo is fine.</p>\r\n<p>Playback at 48kHz is fine, although depending on the output model used that may mean sample rate conversion is applied</p>\r\n<p>Yes, file streaming is completely possible. Have a look at the SkypeFX project for an example. (also PracticeSharp)</p>\r\n<p>NAudio can run on x86 and x64. At the moment it is recommended you build your app to target x86 so it runs as 32 bit on 64 bit windows to ensure there are no interop issues (also ACM codecs seem only to be available for 32 bit)</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
