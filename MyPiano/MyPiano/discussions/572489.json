It will just show you that the microphone is receving something.\r<br />\n<br />\nI`ve seen the NAudio wpf demo and saw that you are doing the same thing in the WASAPI capture demo, but i need to start recording. So how does windows make it so that it always displays the sound bar changes without having to record anything ?\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://d64.imgup.net/Untitled798e.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n",
