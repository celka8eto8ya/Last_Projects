Is this a bug or by design? <br />\n<br />\nI make audio processing on the WAV and get a list of timestamps, this list should be in sync with the MP3 file. But due to the 15 min difference the timestamps does not match the MP3 audio.<br />\nIs there a way to have a timestamp I generated from the WAV and sync it to the MP3?<br />\n",
