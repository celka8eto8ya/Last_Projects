    "Html": "Sorry, ra and rm are not open formats, and NAudio has no built-in support for them. I'd look for a command-line tool that converts it to WAV.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnd yes you can use a BiQUad filter for adjusting bass. Look in the WPF project at the example graphic equalizer source code to pick up some ideas on how to do this.\r<br />\n<br />\nMark<br />\n",
