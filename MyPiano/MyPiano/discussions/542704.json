The good thing is that it just got cut off and all I need to do is to add a horizontal scroll to be able to see the ones that are cut off.\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried doing &quot;waveViewer1.HorizontalScroll.Visible = true;&quot;\r<br />\nThis shows the scrollbar when i load the audio but it doesn't work at all.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease tell me how I can fix this!\r<br />\nAlso, is it possible to export the waveforms into vector format (SVG)?<br />\n",
