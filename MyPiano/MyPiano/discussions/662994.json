    "Html": "Hi, this is not a trivial task. For realtime processing you can´t process the data in the time domain, which would be simple coding (using the class &quot;ImpulseResponseConvolution&quot;). The only approach is complex and demands a lot of knowledge: you need to transform the data in the frequency domain, process it and transform it back. For transformation the &quot;FastFourierTransform&quot; (FFT) or &quot;ShortTermFourierTransform&quot; (STFT) is commonly used. Unfortunately, there is no implementation available in NAudio, but good luck (and pls provide if you can deploy it).<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hello, so I tried to do FFT with use of SampleAggregator.cs, but I'm not shure, if I realy understand class SampleAggregator - Is that instance, witch take samples from my wave file (or any input), and apply FFT algorythm for every single sample of my wave file - this is the method Add in this class -right? And length of FFT means, how large is step between couted frequencies in spectrum? For example if is frequency of my point[n] = 100Hz, frequency of point[n+1] is my sample rate/ FFT length, so if I've got sample rate 44100 and FFT length 1024, point[n+1] = point[n]+(44100/1024), so if my point[n] is 100 my point[n+1]=  143,066.... ??? I'm right or absolutly dumb...?? :-D \r<br />\nThanks for answer.<br />\n",
