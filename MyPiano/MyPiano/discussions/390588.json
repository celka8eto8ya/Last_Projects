As&nbsp;the waveout reaches the end of the wavefile I use the playbackStopped event to reset the player. However, if the headset is removed during the playback I get &quot;MmException was unhandled&quot; &quot;NoDriver calling WaveOutWrite&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how to catch that exception, I would really appreciate all the help I can get! :)</p>\r\n",
