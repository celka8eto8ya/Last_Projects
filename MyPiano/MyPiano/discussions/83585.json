I must admit the FFT was thrown in at the very last minute before a demo I was doing, and I never got round to investigating the cause of the high values on the left-hand-side. One suggestion I heard was that the presence of a DC offset can cause this, so perhaps a high-pass filter would help things along a bit.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
