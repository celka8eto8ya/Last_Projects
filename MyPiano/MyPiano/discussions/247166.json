I have the following code:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\n<pre>IWavePlayer player = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> WaveOut();\nWaveStream reader = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> WaveFileReader(filePath);\nWaveChannel32 input = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> WaveChannel32(reader);\n\nAmplitudeStream ampStream = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> AmplitudeStream(input);\nampStream.AmplitudeEventHandler += <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> EventHandler&lt;AmplitudeArgs&gt;(AmplitudeStreamHandler);\n\nplayer.Init(ampStream);\nplayer.Play();\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AmplitudeStream is a class I made that implements WaveStream so that I can 'track' and send an event whenever data is read from the file. However, my problem is that I want to control how much bytes are read. Since the Read function of AmplitudeStream is  being called by the Play() function, I have no idea on how I can limit the number of bytes read (it is always 35,280). How to do this? I am using the Play() command because I want my file to play so that I can observe. So if there is another way to play the  file during the Read() command, which would look something like:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">byte</span>[] buffer = <span style=\"color: blue;\">byte</span>[8192]\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">int</span> bytesRead = 0;\n\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">do</span>{\n\nbytesRead = ampStream.Read(buffer,0,buffer.Length);\n\n}<span style=\"color: blue;\">while</span>(bytesRead != 0);\n\n@<span style=\"color: blue;\">override</span>\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">private</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">int</span> Read(<span style=\"color: blue;\">byte</span>[] buffer, <span style=\"color: blue;\">int</span> offset, <span style=\"color: blue;\">int</span> count)\n{\n\n<span style=\"color: green;\">//some command to play the file here</span>\n\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>I would like to know.&nbsp;Thanks! Aside from that, is there a way to not use WaveChannel32? Because for some reason, Im getting some errors when I use the reader for input into the AmplitudeStream (mainly because of some byte-float conversion issue).</p>",
