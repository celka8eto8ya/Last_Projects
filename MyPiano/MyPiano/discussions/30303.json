Have a look at this post on my blog for a bit more information:<br>\r\nhttp://mark-dot-net.blogspot.com/2008/06/naudio-wave-stream-architecture.html<br>\r\nThe MixDiff application currently uses a mixer, although it only plays one of its inputs at a time, so you could look at the code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreams that are mixed can just as easily be written to a WAV file as to the soundcard. Look at the WavFileWriter class for creating WAV files. NAudio demo shows WAV files being created in the ACM and WaveIn recording pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for performance, I have used NAudio to mix over 30 streams together on a fairly low spec PC, but they were only 8kHz audio. You should not expect performance to be anything like what you will get in SONAR, due to limitations of .NET and the fact that NAudio has not been as heavily optimised as we would like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ASIO output driver is still in its early stages and is not working with every soundcard we have tested yet. Let us know if you get it working, and what soundcard you are using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most reliable output driver at the moment is WaveOut.
