The amplitude changes in samples during this 10 seconds. Same amplitude is in 2 full periods of sinus and then increases. I know exactly which sample has how many amplitude (level) in samples.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The question:</strong><br />\nI should stop playing samples if user press a button on keyboard and then I should know amplitude (level) of the actually played sample (not value). So I should know which sample is playing currently... then I would know to calculate the amplitude from current sample number.<br />\n<br />\nHow can I determine which sample was played in sample list when user pressed a button? What is the sample number of current played sample?<br />\n",
