After that, I convert the waveStream into float[] buffer.\r<br />\nNow I want to locate the float value of mainOutputStream.CurrentTime of the wav file. Can I know any method can retrieve it?\r<br />\nLet's say the mainOutputStream.CurrentTime is 00:01:08.9720000, can I calculate the float value of at cuurent time 00:01:08.9720000? Any code in Naudio can be used to do that?\r<br />\nHope I describe clearly enough. Thanks a lot.<br />\n",
