I noticed that the both totalTime &amp; CurrentTime is double of the actual time.\r<br />\nI used your WinForm DEMO &amp; got the same results. MP3 file length is 28 sec , while the Simple Playback demo shows that 59 sec.\r<br />\nNB. I used your Demo &quot;Media Foundation Demo&quot; with the same file , and shows the correct time, which is 28 sec. Unfortunately, I plan to use the application in WinXP , so the media Foundation will not be used.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo get sample mp3 I used , please check the below 4Shared link:\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.4shared.com/mp3/xgrK0h78ba/sample.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.4shared.com/mp3/xgrK0h78ba/sample.html</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nWaleed<br />\n",
