I was attempting to convert from the former PCM format to the later u-Law format and the WaveConversionStream threw an exception. The size of those two files appears to be the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-G<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi geiman,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main difference is to do with dynamic range. While with 8 bit PCM, the 256 volume levels are evenly distributed, with u-law and a-law they are on a curve that improves the quality of encoding speech. Not sure why you would get the exception. Normally you go from u-law to 16 bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCM, &quot;In telephony, a standard audio signal for a single phone call is encoded as 8000 analog samples per second, of 8 bits each, giving a 64 kbit/s digital signal known as DS0. The default signal compression encoding on a DS0 is either Âµ-law (mu-law) PCM (North America and Japan) or A-law PCM (Europe and most of the rest of the world).&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I receive a 16gHz, 8bit mono PCM file, it is my understanding that this will eventually be converted to u-Law to be played on a telephony device, but it does seem possible to convert any 8 bit PCM to u-Law using NAudio, so perhaps I am misunderstanding something. I always get the exception &quot;NAudio.MmException:&nbsp;AcmNotPossible&nbsp;calling&nbsp;acmStreamOpen&quot;. I have tried using multiple WaveConversionStreams but have not been successful.<br>\r\n",
