I have looked  through the other discussions and there doesn't appear to be anyone else using this library to do this kind of thing, but I was wondering if anyone is able to help me out? Here is the relevant code:</p>\n<p>(I have used the waveprovider classes as shown on the blog post, without editing them)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">internal</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">class</span> GenerateSound\n    {\n        <span style=\"color: blue;\">private</span> WaveOut _waveOut;\n       \n        <span style=\"color: blue;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">void</span> StartSineWave(SineWaveProvider sineWaveProvider)\n        {\n            sineWaveProvider.SetWaveFormat(8000, 1); <span style=\"color: green;\">// 16kHz mono</span>\n            sineWaveProvider.Frequency = 1000;\n            sineWaveProvider.Amplitude = 0.25f;\n            _waveOut = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> WaveOut();\n            _waveOut.Init(sineWaveProvider);\n            _waveOut.DesiredLatency = 100;\n            _waveOut.Play();\n            \n        }\n\n        <span style=\"color: blue;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">void</span> StopSineWave()\n        {\n            _waveOut.Stop();\n            _waveOut.Dispose();\n            _waveOut = <span style=\"color: blue;\">null</span>;\n        }                  &nbsp;</pre>\n<pre>    }</pre>\n</div>\n<p>then to play the sound, my main initialises an instance of the sinewaveProvider, then updates the frequency when the mouse is moved by setting sineWaveProvider.Frequency.</p>\n<p>I just can't figure out why, when the frequency of the instance of the sinewave is changed, playback stops momentarily before playing the next frequency</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Matt</p>",
