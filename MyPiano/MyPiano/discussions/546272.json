When an audiofile is playing (mp3 or wav doesnt matter) and i press down on the close, maximize or minimize button (without letting go) the sound pauses playing.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is quite annoying. I use waveout api and audiofilereader.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyways, it's a bug from NAudio I'm afraid :(\r<br />\n<br />\nCould you fix this?<br />\n",
