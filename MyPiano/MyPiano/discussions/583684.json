I currently don't have a clue on how to achieve this with NAudio, but I think it should be possible.\r<br />\n<br />\nFirst I would have to retrieve the current active audio output device, then I'd have to apply an effect. Can anyone show me how this can be done?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!\r<br />\nRegards<br />\n",

You would need to create the effect algorithms yourself, or borrow them from elsewhere.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, if you want to intercept sound being played by other applications, this is not something that the underlying Windows audio infrastructure allows you to do easily, and cannot be done with NAudio.<br />\n",
