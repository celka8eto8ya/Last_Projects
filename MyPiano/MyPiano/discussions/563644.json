So cudos!!\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm getting ready to migrate my app target .Net 4.5 (for new 4.5 language features mostly). Has anyone compiled NAudio to target 4.5? If yes, does it all work? Any gotchas you know of?<br />\n",

So yeah, I'm getting careful with development &quot;upgrades&quot;. ;-) \r<br />\n<br />\nMark, that's good to know. So it sounds like I can just keep using my .Net 4.0 NAudio 1.7 dlls. And they will work fine with a .Net 4.5 app. <br />\n",
