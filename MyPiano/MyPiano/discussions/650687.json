I've tried to compare readfullystream.Position and httpwebresponse.ContentLength, but in some reason ContentLength is always bigger, than Position, although ContentLength is a length of mp3 file byte array. Manipulations with bufferedWaveProvider don't work too.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/2vAq2wM.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pic related</a><br />\n",
