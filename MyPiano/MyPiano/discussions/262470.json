He can then mute this basetrack at specific points for N duration and repeated intervals. He can then add aditional loops (&lt;15 sec) on top\r\n of this base track to create his own mix. Simple in concept right?</p>\r\n<p>I got the mixer working but I just cant figure out how to create the muted sections on the basetrack.</p>\r\n<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n<p>Great library by the way. Cheers.</p>\r\n",
