    "Html": "<p>Hi!</p>\r\n<p>1. I believe that there is a function called .CurrentTime which returns a TimeSpan variable. I think you can use it to get the current time.</p>\r\n<p>2. Im not too sure but maybe you can make calculations based on the time you want to seek and convert it into Position? I think there is an example in NAudioDemo where you can seek where to play the file.</p>\r\n<p>Goodluck! Also, may I ask how you are playing the file? Do you know of any other way to play a file rather than using the IWavePlayer? Im having trouble because I need to play a file while controlling the # of bytes that are read each time.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
