I just want to implement a &quot;monitor&quot; function to check each input channel by visualizing the volume with the VolumeMeter. I already used the asio recording demo by Mark and adapted it to my needs. But currently i don't have a clue how to solve this problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks \r<br />\nJan<br />\n",
