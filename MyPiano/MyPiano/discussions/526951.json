It works great . Thanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nBut ,at a certain time , I need to add a byte array to the WaveFileWriter. I fist save this byte array to the WaveFileWriter by  Mywriter.Write(fileByte, 0, fileByte.Length - 1) . then I continue to add data received from the serial port normally. NB. this byte Array I add is amplified (by converting to float , then multiply , then convert to byte again)\r<br />\n<br />\nProblem , \r<br />\nWhen I run the recorded file , it works great for the audio coming from the serial port , and for the sound that is added manually , but after this any sound coming from the serial port is recorded in a very very high volume. I do not know why.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny Idea ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for the great control and for the Excellent support. \r<br />\nWaleed<br />\n",
