I only need to get the actual bits with no header and ancillary info. \r<br />\nCan I use NAudio to do that? \r<br />\nI have found Mp3FileReader class and Mp3Frame class there. Also found a RawData variable but don't know how to use them.<br />\n",

Once you have the raw PCM samples, you'll need to do voice analysis.  I'm not familiar with the state of the art there, but there's plenty of documentation out there: <a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=voice+analysis+algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google</a>.\r<br />\n<br />\nGood luck!<br />\n",
