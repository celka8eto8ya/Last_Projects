    "Html": "<p>Hi Becoz,</p>\r\n<p>You will need to monitor what is happening through the source that you want to record until you find the event in the audio stream which will trigger your recording. So if you are looking to record audio data (from here on in I will refer to this as <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">saving</span> the audio data, it's an important distinction) you will still need to capture (aka record) the data from the audio stream, check if the event has occurred (the volume level on the stream coming in) and then decide if you want to save the data. If you don't want to save the data then you trow it away and check the next block.</p>\r\n<p>Think of it like recording a concert. Your going to still be listing to the concert and the concert is still going to be playing even if your not recording (i.e. saving) the data that you hear. So effectively what you want to do is not to stop recording the data but to stop saving it until an event you are looking for occurs.</p>\r\n<p>To answer the part about the event, being the level of the volume, look at the sample code provided in the application with NAudio, there is a peak meter there which you could reuse the code from to help you identify when a peak level has been reached.</p>\r\n<p>~DSebJ</p>",
