I noticed that the latency can be set for playback devices, but I have not found where or even if that can also be acheived when writing to a file. The background music is all in .mp3 format and it gets rather choppy when mixed to the voice stream and rendered to a file. Any help is appreciated. (Note:&nbsp;Have been unable to&nbsp;read the tutorials as my workplace blocks all blog-type sites).</p>",
