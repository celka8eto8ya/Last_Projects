(My application wrote in wpf .net 4 and run on WinXP). my GUI thread need to do hard work to paint the waveform and the fft and sometimes the sound and the displaying arent smooth. can you  tell me please if its better for me to use another IWavePlayer (maybe Asio)? or WaveOut with EventCallback?</p>\n<p>2. A part of my req is to decrease the volume or mute (not the windows volume but the player) but i want to keep showing the waveform and the fft. there is way to do that? (i use WaveChannel32)</p>\n<p>I'll really appreciate&nbsp;your answer</p>",
