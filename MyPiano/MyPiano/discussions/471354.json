Other?\r<br />\n<br />\nIs it possible for future versions to allow all readers to receive streams on its constructors besides filenames? WMAFileReader and AudioFileReader only have one constructor receiving filenames. By allowing passing streams to all readers, the use case where audio should be read from a memory-stream (instead of file-streams) could get covered.<br />\n",
