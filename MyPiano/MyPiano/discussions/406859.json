But I cannot create an instance of WaveIn using MMDevice. The only way to associate WaveIn object with the audio capture device is its device\r\n index. But device index may change if we plug/unplug audio capture device.</p>\r\n<p>Using MMDevice we can create an instance of WasapiCapture and capture audio from it but is not supported on XP.</p>\r\n<p>I want to preserve the selected audio device ID somewhere (like database) so that my application can capture audio from that device when it launches for the next time. Is there any solution?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n",
