But in some cases I just copied code from a sample not knowing what the values really mean to performance, memory usage, etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnd if it is a wiki style, discussion members could contribute to it and correct it overtime. \r<br />\n<br />\nMost importantly it would free up more of Mark's time to do coding rather than answering the same newbie questions for the millionth time. :-)\r<br />\n<br />\nJust my 2 cents. <br />\n",
