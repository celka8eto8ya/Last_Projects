If you want to remember it, and control it, then create your own MixingSampleProvider and add and remove inputs as needed. \r<br />\n<br />\nAnd yes, you can play other files after one has stopped, so long as your mixer is set up to always produce sound (i.e. silence) even when no inputs are connected<br />\n",
