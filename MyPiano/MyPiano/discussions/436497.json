However, the signal is littered with peaks and noise. When I dumped into excel to view output from converted array(just recorded single tone) it had the semblence of correct sine wave/frequency buried amidst all sorts of errant samples. (I also tried reversing to account for endianess). When I choose WaveFileWriter and render as .wav, it sounds perfect. So something is getting lost in translation.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat object would convert the buffer to Linear PCM samples?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank You<br />\n",
