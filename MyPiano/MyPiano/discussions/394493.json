While debugging I noticed<br>\r\nAfter the PCM conversion, the WaveMixerStream32() converts to IeeeFloat. <br>\r\nSo I go from MuLaw --&gt; PCM --&gt; IeeeFloat. I believe this is where I'm getting the alvin &amp; the chipmunks<br>\r\nsuper fast playback from. If this is the case I believe I can fix it by modifying the WaveChannel32 class<br>\r\nso that it doesn't convert to IeeeFloat, but I wanted to make sure I was on the right track.</p>\r\n<p>Any helpful insight would be very much appreciated.</p>\r\n",

If you just want to play the audio directly, there is no need for the WaveOffsetStream, WaveChannel32, or WaveMixerStream32. Also, those tutorials are very old. It would be better to look at the NAudioDemo source code for examples of how to do playback.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
