I can play a .wav file from disk but I need to play the sound directly from a properly formatted (8-bit, mono) byte array without creating a temporary file on disk.

    "Html": "Hello Paul,<br />\n<br />\nI don´t have the time to show you exactly what to do, but in your case I´d create a new MemoryStream from your bytearray.<br />\nThen just use NAudio to play your stream. Example (just for demonstration):<br />\n<pre><code>Private Sub Play(ByVal DeviceID as Integer, ByVal Bytearray() as Byte) \n\nDim MemStream as new MemoryStream(Bytearray)\nDim WOut as new NAudio.Wave.WaveOut(DeviceID)\nWOut.Init(MemStream)\nWOut.Play()\n\nEnd Sub</code></pre>\n\nKind regards<br />\n<br />\nFreefall<br />\n",

    "Html": "Thank you Freefall. I started playing with MemoryStream yesterday and have something working which is similar to your code. By using <strong>WaveFormat</strong> and <strong>RawSourceWaveStream</strong> I can fill my byte array with raw data and do not need to add the 44 byte wav header which I was doing before.\r<br />\n<br />\nI think NAudio is going to be very useful in my audio projects.\r<br />\n<br />\nPaul.<br />\n",
