However, I noticed few sample delays between different microphones.\r<br />\n<br />\nI know that for this sort of application that require no/low latency, NAudio is not preferable. I was wondering if I can reduce the latency between different USB mic further by using WASAPI or if you would suggest using other libraries. <br />\n",
