You can create a buffer that matches the stream, if you know exactly what the format of the buffer is going to be but I still don't think that would be a resolution that is going to support what you do due to the u-Law block - which would lead me to think this isn't a wave stream in the first place...</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,<br>OpenSebJ</p>",
