You can ignore the WASAPI there, it´s just for test purposes currently.<br />\n<br />\nNow, as you can see, i have an EvetHandler, so i am trying to save the stream.<br />\nIn wavein, it was pretty straightforward, but i can´t do it in ASIO.<br />\n<pre><code>        void Aut_AudioAvailable(object sender, NAudio.Wave.AsioAudioAvailableEventArgs e)\n        {\n\n            //waveWriter.Write(e.InputBuffers, 0, e.SamplesPerBuffer);\n        }</code></pre>\n\nI don´t know what to write in waveWriter. so i have been trying the command available.<br />\nI have also tried search alot for it, but it seems no one has done recording with Asio, at least not put it on the Internet (Using NAudio).<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n<br />\nEDIT: waveWriter = new NAudio.Wave.WaveFileWriter(tmpfile.FileName, sourceStream.WaveFormat);<br />\nForgot to post that if it´s necessary.<br />\n",
