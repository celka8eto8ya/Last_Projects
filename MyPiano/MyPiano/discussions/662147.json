But having difficulties extracting from the Demo stuff how some of the library modules might go together for ASIO streaming.  I'm OK with the network part having the working code from my previous effort with Rob Philpot's code embedded in my application.  ANY HELPERS OUT THERE???????\r<br />\nKarin <br />\n",
