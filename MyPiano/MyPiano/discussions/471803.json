When I try to add the NAudio library from nuget, it shows me error. &quot; 'NAudio' could not be installed because it is not compatible with any project in the solution. The project targets the following frameworks:  .NETFramework,Version=v3.5<br />\nWindows,Version=v8.0 &quot;<br />\n<br />\nI have installed .NETFramework 3.5 manually later but still the problem exists. Can you give me any solution to this or can tell me what I am doing wrong please? I am making the App for Windows Phone 8 using XAML.<br />\n",
