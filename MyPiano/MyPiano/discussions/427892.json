You could take a copy of the MP3 file reader code and just remove the TOC generation if you wanted. There is also a demo\r\n of streaming MP3 over the internet in NAudioDemo, which obviously by its nature, doesn't read ahead. You simply parse MP3 frames and decompress them.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>\r\n",
