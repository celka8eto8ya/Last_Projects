This is not the issue however as the same problem ocurrs with a single sound card.</p>\r\n<p>I am playing back a wav file. When I close the program, an error message is thrown that says the WavOut device was not closed. Also, the file crackles after it finished playing.</p>\r\n<p>There probably is a method lurking around in NAudio that I am not calling. I have a feeling I need to dispose of the WaveOut object after the files are done. I called the dispose method, but the program does not wait for the wav file finished playing.</p>\r\n<p>How do you rectify this situation?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Ben (kingneb)&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

As far as the crackling was concerned, that was due to the sound cards being USB and run through a hub. Those USB hubs are not a great thing for audio.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyway Thanks</p>",
