Did I miss a step?</p>\r\n<p>Also, it appears that Nuget just gives you the binaries, so if you want to debug into the Naudio stuff (to find a bug - for example), you have to link to an Naudio solution. Is that the right/best way to do it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>eejake52</p>\r\n",
