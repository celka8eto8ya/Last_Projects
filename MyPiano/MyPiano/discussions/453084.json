When I went in to abstract out the WaveProvider, so I could support this, I ran into a problem.  Originally I was just using AudioFileReader, which provides a volume property.  MediaFoundationReader does not.\r<br />\n<br />\nWould it be possible to move this property up to IWaveProvider, especially since the documentation says to use volume there instead of WaveOut?<br />\n",
