So it gets to the end of the stream and just stops.  The reason for the repeat was code I have to detect a threading problem ( <a href=\"https://naudio.codeplex.com/discussions/357995\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://naudio.codeplex.com/discussions/357995</a>  ) where waveplayer would start to play a track and just stop. I have updated the code to also check if we are at the end of the stream and fire off the next track.  While this works it doesnt seem ideal.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas on why wavePlayer isnt changing to PlaybackState.Stopped state at the end of the stream?<br />\n",

    "Html": "What IWavePlayer implementation are you using?\r<br />\nThe idea is that FileWaveStream's Read method should return 0 when it reaches the end. Then the wavePlayer knows that it can stop playing. So you could start by writing a simple test that keeps calling Read on your FileWaveStream (e.g. into a buffer of 1024) and ensure that it eventually returns 0.<br />\n",
