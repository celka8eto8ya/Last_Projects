    "Html": "this is not a trivial problem to solve. First you simply should learn to count sounds, by examining the volume of the samples. You'd need to check for one or more samples going above a certain threshold in a set time period, to avoid double-counting the same sound. Once you've done that, then it would be a matter of using filters or FFTs to attempt to differentiate between the sounds you are looking for and other sounds.<br />\n",
