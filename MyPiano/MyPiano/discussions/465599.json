When the volume is lowered through the UI, I adjust the volume to the left and right channel before I make the panning adjustments.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis method seems to work, but when we lower the volume, I hear a hissing sound. How can we eliminate that?\r<br />\n<br />\nI basically do the following code:\r<br />\n<br />\nthis.sourceBuffer[n] *= LeftVolume\r<br />\nthis.sourceBuffer[n+1] *= RightVolume\r<br />\n<br />\nWhere in my case, left and right volume are the same values (somewhere between 0.0 and 1.0) and after I adjust volume factor, I make a panning adjustment based on either or not the original audio stream is stereo or mono.\r<br />\n<br />\nThoughts?\r<br />\n<br />\nPaul<br />\n",
