    "Html": "Mp3FileReader will work best with the Fraunhoffer MP3 codec. Lame is an MP3 encoder - so I'm not even sure it will contain a decoder. Also the expected WAVEFORMAT structure will likely be different between ACM MP3 codecs. If you can install the &quot;Desktop Experience&quot; component of Windows Server that might help.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, Mp3FileReader allows pluggable alternative MP3 frame decoders. So you can ask it to use the DmoMp3FrameDecompressor instead, which might be installed.<br />\n",
