    "Html": "\r\n<p>it can be done, but it is a little tricky. Essentially you'd need to keep hold of the audio you'd already downloaded in some kind of memory buffer or temporary file. I'm afraid there is no sample code. One thing that you might want to check out is the new\r\n MediaFoundationReader in the very latest NAudio code (you'll probably have to download and build it yourself). That can actually do repositioning on streaming files and works surprisingly well. I don't know if you can tell how far it has downloaded though.</p>\r\n",
