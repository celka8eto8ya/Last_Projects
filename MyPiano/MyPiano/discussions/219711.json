I would like to create an application that allows me to play different .wav files simultaniously (synchronised)&nbsp;through outputs that I have specified - i.e. wav1 through outputs 1 &amp; 2 and wav2 through outputs 3 &amp; 4. Is this possible using nAudio? How would I go about acheiving this?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance...&nbsp;</p>",
