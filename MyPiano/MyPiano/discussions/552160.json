FFT is calculated by a sample aggregator which is provided in the WPF Sound Visualization Library source code. The spectrum works well, but it seems volume dependent. When the NAudio player is muted, the spectrum s not displayed.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way to make FFT calculation independent of the volume?<br />\n",

    "Html": "Yes, you need to move the FFT calculation earlier in your signal chain, before the volume control is applied. The NAudio demo shows a similar concept where the waveform visualisation is drawn before the volume, but the volume meter visualisation is drawn after volume is applied.<br />\n",
