ResamplerDMOStream is a very new feature of NAudio and is still a work in progress. It would appear that your PC doesn't have the COM object registered. Can I ask what operating system you are using? I was developing on Vista, and haven't got round to seeing what happens in XP yet.<br>\r\nI am planning to release a new version of NAudio in the coming weeks though, but for now there is nothing stopping you downloading the code and compiling your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark<br>\r\n",
