So, I have followed NetworkChat demo source code and run NetworkChat demo Application on Desktop and Laptop . But whenever I run NetworkChat demo Application it generates low Echo on Desktop and too much high Echo on Laptop . I have tried all other popular chat application like Skype on my Desktop and Laptop but Skype don't returns any Echo . <br />\n  Is there any way that I can Suppress this Echo and make a Professional Chat Application like Skype by using Naudio ?<br />\n  I'm eagerly waiting for useful reply.<br />\n<br />\nthanks,<br />\nShuvam  <br />\n",

    "Html": "Yes this demo has no echo cancellation algorithm which you would need for a professional chat application. NAudio does not include an echo cancellation algorithm, so you'd need to write your own, or make use of a third party one. There seems to be a Media Foundation Transform AEC algorithm in the latest versions of Windows which may be of use.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou may also be interested that in the next few weeks a new Pluralsight course about NAudio is about to be released, and I have a module about this network chat demo, in which I explain the need for echo suppression.\r<br />\n<br />\nMark<br />\n",
