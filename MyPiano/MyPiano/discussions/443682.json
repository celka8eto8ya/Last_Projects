In the WaveFileReader.cs the section <br />\n<pre><code>                if (chunkLength &lt; 0 || chunkLength &gt; stream.Length - stream.Position)\n                {\n                    Debug.Assert(false, String.Format(&quot;Invalid chunk length {0}, pos: {1}. length: {2}&quot;,\n                        chunkLength, stream.Position, stream.Length));\n                    // an exception will be thrown further down if we haven't got a format and data chunk yet,\n                    // otherwise we will tolerate this file despite it having corrupt data at the end\n                    break;\n                }\n</code></pre>\n\ncauses a popup-window because of the debug assertion. However, the .wav-file can be played without a problem. So I guess NAudio 1.5 is a debug-build. Is it possible to deliver NAudio 1.5 as a release-build instead of the debug version? That would help a lot.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks &amp; Best regards\r<br />\nKay<br />\n",
