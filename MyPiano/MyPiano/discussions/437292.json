    "Html": "Yes, FFT is a very good way of getting frequency information. There are other approaches, particularly if your incoming signal has a single tone (e.g. you are making a guitar tuner). Look at the demo code that comes with NAudio to see FFT in action to draw a spectrum analyzer with NAudio.\r<br />\n<br />\nMark<br />\n",
