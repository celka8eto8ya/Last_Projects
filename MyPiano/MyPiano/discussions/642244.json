Usually it's around 15% but i've seen 30% and 100% also.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is more or less the code i'm using (I created a test program to make sure it wasn't something else in my main program causing the issue)<br />\n<pre><code>Imports NAudio.CoreAudioApi\nImports NAudio.Wave\n\nPublic Class Form1\n    Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load\n        Dim WavePlayer As WasapiOut\n        Dim DefaultAudioDevice As New MMDeviceEnumerator\n        WavePlayer = New WasapiOut(DefaultAudioDevice.GetDefaultAudioEndpoint(DataFlow.Render, Role.Multimedia), AudioClientShareMode.Shared, True, 0)\n        WavePlayer.Init(New WaveChannel32(New WaveFileReader(&quot;C:\\Users\\Marc\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2015\\Projects\\Wasapi Test\\test.wav&quot;)))\n        WavePlayer.Play()\n    End Sub\nEnd Class\n</code></pre>\n\nIs there a way I can change the implementation of the code, or is there an issue with WasapiOut in Windows 10?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance\r<br />\n<br />\nMarc<br />\n",
