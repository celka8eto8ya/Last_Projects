    "Html": "I am doing MP3 playback using AudioFileReader and WaveOut.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am able to set AudioFileReader.Position in code while a song is playing, and it works great. The playback jumps to the new position and continues without missing a beat.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, if I call WaveOut.Pause(), then change AudioFileReader.Position, then call WaveOut.Resume(), the playback resumes, but the output is garbled. If I don't change the position in between the Pause() and Resume(), everything is fine.  It's only the specific case of Pause() -&gt; change Position -&gt; Resume() that cause the garbled playback.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this a known bug, or am I doing something wrong?\r<br />\n<br />\n-Joe<br />\n",
