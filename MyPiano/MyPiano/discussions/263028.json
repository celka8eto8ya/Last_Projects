I want to know if it possible to display spectrum and waveform without play the file, I mean I don't care if it play in backgroung but I donw want to hear the sound.</p>\r\n<p>2. I saw to classes that I can use &quot;SampleChannel&quot; and &quot;WaveChannel32&quot; which is better? and what is the comparable method in &quot;SampleChannel&quot; to &quot;RaiseSample&quot; in WaveChannel32&quot; ?</p>\r\n<p>3. I familiar with NAudio lib (more or less) and I'll very appreciate if someone can give me a brief how do to that.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",

You can easily create your own ISampleProvider that has a RaiseSample event if you need it.</p>\r\n<p>3. not sure what this question means</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
