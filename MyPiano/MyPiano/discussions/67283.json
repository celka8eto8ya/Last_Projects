One issue you face is that speeding up audio also results in the &quot;chipmunk effect&quot;, so pitch shifting is also required. If you look at the <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/skypefx\">Skype Voice Changer</a> project, you will see how to do pitch shifting, but speed-up is not supported.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
