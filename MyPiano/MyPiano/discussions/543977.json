    "Html": "I'm trying to get our corporate voicemails to play in a website. The vms are stored on an imap server. I have sucessfully retrieved the wav file attachments and converted them to mp3 using Naudio.Lame. That solution plays the voicemail on all modern desktop browsers, but no mobile browser is playing the file. What should I be converting the 8-bit mono wav file to for audio playback using HTML5 in desktop browsers as well as mobile browsers?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nJeremy<br />\n",
