Here is the code I used :</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>WaveFormat format = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> WaveFormat((<span style=\"color:blue\">int</span>)sampleRate, 16, 1);\r\nWaveFileWriter fileWriter = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> WaveFileWriter(path &#43; <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;/&quot;</span> &#43; sampleName &#43; <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;.wav&quot;</span>, format);\r\nfileWriter.Write(soundFont.SampleData, generator.SampleHeader.start, (<span style=\"color:blue\">int</span>)(generator.SampleHeader.end - generator.SampleHeader.start));\r\nfileWriter.Flush();\r\nfileWriter.Close();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The generator object is a SampleID generator from the Soundfont object.</p>\r\n<p>The wave file is generated but when I play it in VLC, the sound is not correct. It's too short and sounds awfull. Maybe my mistake come from the format configuration, but I have no idea how to solve this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would help me a lot if someone could help me with this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks</p>\r\n",

Seems like the Start, End, LoopStart and LoopEnd value of a Sample Header are devided by 2... I have no idea why, and I would be glad if someone could explain me.<br /><br />Anyway, this code is working :</p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">uint</span> len = offsetEnd - offsetStart;\r\nWaveFormat format = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> WaveFormat((<span style=\"color: blue;\">int</span>)sampleRate, 16, 1);\r\nWaveFileWriter fileWriter = <span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> WaveFileWriter(path, format);\r\nfileWriter.Write(soundFont.SampleData, <span style=\"color: blue;\">checked</span>((<span style=\"color: blue;\">int</span>)offsetStart)*2, <span style=\"color: blue;\">checked</span>((<span style=\"color: blue;\">int</span>) len)*2);\r\nfileWriter.Flush();\r\nfileWriter.Close();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
