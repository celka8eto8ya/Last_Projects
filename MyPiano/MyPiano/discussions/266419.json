I tried to use mixer. &nbsp;I have a 16 bit waveFormat and there's a&nbsp;WaveMixerStream32 class that needs 32 bit waveformat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It would be nice if you can help me to setup a mixer for my scenario.</p>\r\n<p>I have something like this:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;WaveFormat wf = new WaveFormat(8000, 16, 1); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;waveProvider = new BufferedWaveProvider(wf);</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;waveOut = new WaveOut();&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How can I add my waveProvider to mixer? I found&nbsp;WaveProviderToWaveStream in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">stackoverflow.com</a>&nbsp;post of you for adding provider to mixer.
