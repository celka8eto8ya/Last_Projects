The total phone call will include both  what I record &amp; what I play). I tried to below code (to make question simple) , but the file length should be the same as source , eg 11 sec. , but it records teh file which is 60 seconds. the sound is very slooooooow , ie , when i use external audio application to play the sound faster , i get the same sound. What is wrong.<br />\n<pre><code>Dim Mywriter As WaveFileWriter\n        Mywriter = New WaveFileWriter(&quot;E:\\Debug\\Audio\\General\\mmmm.wav&quot;, New WaveFormat(8000, 16, 1))\n\n        Dim sf As New Mp3FileReader(&quot;E:\\Debug\\Audio\\General\\intro.mp3&quot;)\n        Dim fileByte(sf.Length) As Byte\n\n        sf.Read(fileByte, 0, sf.Length)\n        Mywriter.Write(fileByte, 0, sf.Length - 1)  \n\n        Mywriter.Close()</code></pre>\n\nThanks,<br />\n",
