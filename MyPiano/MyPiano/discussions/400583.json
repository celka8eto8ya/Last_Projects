To do this I&nbsp;basically follow example from documentation, my code looks like this:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">private</span> Mp3FileReader _mp3Reader; \r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">private</span> WaveOut _wavePlayer; \r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">private</span> Timer _timer;\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">private</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">double</span>? _endSec;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">void</span> Play( <span style=\"color:blue\">double</span> startSec, <span style=\"color:blue\">double</span>? endSec )\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t_endSec = endSec;\r\n\r\n\t\t\t_mp3Reader.CurrentTime = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> TimeSpan( (<span style=\"color:blue\">long</span>)( startSec * 10000000 ) );\r\n\r\n\t\t\t_wavePlayer.Play();\r\n\r\n\t\t\t_timer.Start();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">private</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">void</span> Timer_Tick( <span style=\"color:blue\">object</span> sender, EventArgs e )\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">if</span>( _endSec.HasValue &amp;&amp; _mp3Reader.CurrentTime.TotalSeconds &gt;= _endSec.Value )\r\n\t\t\t\tStop();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Everething is great at first time. But when I click Play next time I hear a distinct noise during the first miliseconds of playback. If at the end of the previous playback there was silence, then there will be no noise next time, if at the end of the previous\r\n playback was loud sound, then noise will be loud.</p>\r\n<p>It looks like some internal sound buffer is left with a few milliseconds of sound from previous playback, and so next playback first plays that leftover of previous playback. Is there some way to clear these internal buffers? have you met such problem and\r\n what are solutions for it?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Sergey P.</p>\r\n",

Ideally I'd like to find a fix inside AcmMp3FrameDecompressor itself as this might not perform too well if you are repositioning during playback.</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
