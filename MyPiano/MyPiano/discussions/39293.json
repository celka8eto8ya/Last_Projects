I am pretty sure I could write all of the data to a file, add a header, and then play the file. But more ideal would be a solution that would buffer the data and then play it without the extra file operations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny suggestions about how to do this would be appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
