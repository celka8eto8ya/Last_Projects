Please let me know step by step how I can set those values it will relay very helpful for me.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can set compression from AudioPlaybackPanel.cs. I use DSPEffectStream.cs class for set the compression value but &quot;this.fileWaveStream = new DSPEffectStream(compress1, m_eqE__ffect)&quot;\r<br />\nthis code make shuttering on my song.In below we have set my code.<br />\n<pre><code>private WaveStream fileWaveStream;\npublic WaveChannel32 wavechannel32;\n\nprivate ISampleProvider CreateInputStream(string fileName)\n        {\n           \n                compress1.Attack = Convert.ToDouble(objsetting.Attack);\n                compress1.Release = Convert.ToDouble(objsetting.Release);\n                compress1.Threshold = -10 - (20 + objsetting.Threshold) * 0.2;// trkDBSettings.Value; \n                compress1.Ratio = objsetting.Ratio + 2;\n                compress1.VolumeStatus1L = objsetting.VolumeStatus1L;\n                compress1.VolumeStatus2R = objsetting.VolumeStatus2R;\n                \n                this.fileWaveStream = new DSPEffectStream(compress1, m_eqEffect);\n               \n                return postVolumeMeter;\n            }\n            \n        }</code></pre>\n\n",

Why is happen i don't know?If you want i can provide the code also please reply as soon as possible it's very urgent for me.<br />\n",
