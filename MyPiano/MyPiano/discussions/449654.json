    "Html": "Certainly this is feasible in realtime.  You'll have to write the wavetable synthesis logic, but most of the rest of the plumbing is available in NAudio already.  I would suggest implementing WaveProvider32 and having 8 instances of a custom ISampleProvider inside it to render each &quot;track&quot; or &quot;channel&quot; of audio.  You'll also need to mix the channels inside the WaveProvider32.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou should probably seriously consider whether you need a &quot;MIDI-like&quot; implementation or just a simple mixing audio file player (which could support WAV, <a href=\"http://nlayer.codeplex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MP1 / MP2 / MP3</a>, or <a href=\"http://nvorbis.codeplex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vorbis</a> with minimal code on your part).<br />\n",
