You can click ignore and the app will continue. If you compile in release mode it won't fire at all. Probably NAudio needs to be able to report this type of error in a different way.</p>",

It also has some experimental RF64 support (although I have no RF64 files to test it with). The refactoring opens the door for future custom classes to interpret certain RIFF chunks, and also possibly attempt to correct for RIFF chunks reporting their size wrong, by searching for the next thing that looks like a RIFF chunk header rather than giving up.</p>",
